It seemed from what I heard that Felton’s meat had been delivered at Brookesley for the first time that day. I wondered if it was good and plentiful. Not that I really liked to think about meat, though we were alone again. I thought it crude of him to talk about no noise here, but the toning of a tear, or a sigh of such as bring cowslips for her covering, until I realised that he was thinking that Ben’s friend had been, in point of time, like Felton’s meat. Over the Westphalian ham, which I contrived to share, he read bits of paper about Hilary and the Amazon, and Stella Polaris and Voltaire, and the City of Nagpur, and Vandyck, and other lovely people. I wondered if he wasn’t thinking of going on a holiday. It seemed a pity to me ; so unnecessary, just then. I knew nothing at all about boats. Some of my people had known the old Armadale Castle well enough, doubtless ; but that wasn’t the boat that went to South Africa.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: “Felton’s meat” (product/supplier; clue TBD).
  - CERTAIN: Brookesley (delivery location; exact place TBD).
  - MAYBE: Ben; “Ben’s friend” (referenced via timing comparison).
  - MAYBE: companion “he” (reads “bits of paper” aloud).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “for the first time that day”; “just then”.
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: South Africa (as destination of a “boat”).
  - MAYBE: Amazon; Nagpur; Armadale Castle (castle vs ship ambiguity).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “no noise here, but the toning of a tear… cowslips for her covering” (poetic quotation; source TBD).
  - Reference list: Hilary; Voltaire; Vandyck; Stella Polaris (as “bits of paper” topics).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Westphalian ham shared (echoes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md).
  - “bits of paper” reading as a recurring scene mechanism.
  - Holiday/boats: narrator claims ignorance; contrasts castle vs ship.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Discomfort with meat; attentive to companion’s verbal framing.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md via Westphalian ham + papers/interview vibe.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the Westphalian ham and paper-reading are shown to be unrelated, common details across multiple narrators.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify Brookesley and “Felton’s meat” reference.
  - Identify the quoted line about “toning of a tear” and “cowslips”.
  - Clarify Armadale Castle (castle vs ship) and the South Africa route reference.
