It seemed from what I heard that Felton’s meat had been delivered at Brookesley for the first time that day. I wondered if it was good and plentiful. Not that I really liked to think about meat, though we were alone again. I thought it crude of him to talk about no noise here, but the toning of a tear, or a sigh of such as bring cowslips for her covering, until I realised that he was thinking that Ben’s friend had been, in point of time, like Felton’s meat. Over the Westphalian ham, which I contrived to share, he read bits of paper about Hilary and the Amazon, and Stella Polaris and Voltaire, and the City of Nagpur, and Vandyck, and other lovely people. I wondered if he wasn’t thinking of going on a holiday. It seemed a pity to me ; so unnecessary, just then. I knew nothing at all about boats. Some of my people had known the old Armadale Castle well enough, doubtless ; but that wasn’t the boat that went to South Africa.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - LIKELY: “Felton” alludes to John Felton (1595?–1628), assassin of the Duke of Buckingham (DNB): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Felton,_John_(1595%3F-1628).
  - MAYBE: “Felton’s meat” is wordplay on Buckingham/Villiers as the victim (“meat”) rather than a literal meat supplier.
  - CERTAIN: Brookesley Hall (Leicestershire) as a Villiers family seat: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_Anti-Corn_Law_Struggle/Chapter_3.
  - MAYBE: Ben; “Ben’s friend” (referenced via timing comparison).
  - MAYBE: companion “he” (reads “bits of paper” aloud).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “for the first time that day”; “just then”.
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: South Africa (as destination of a “boat”).
  - MAYBE: Amazon; Nagpur.
  - CERTAIN: Brookesley Hall, Leicestershire (Villiers family seat): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_Anti-Corn_Law_Struggle/Chapter_3.
  - CERTAIN: Armadale Castle (Skye) vs “Armadale Castle” (Union-Castle mail steamer) explains the castle/boat ambiguity (EB1911 “Skye”; EB1911 “Steamship Lines”).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Hush’d be all things, no noise here… Cowslips for her covering.” (Robert Herrick, “An Epitaph upon a Virgin”).
  - Reference list: Hilary; Voltaire; Vandyck; Stella Polaris (as “bits of paper” topics).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Westphalian ham shared (echoes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md).
  - “bits of paper” reading as a recurring scene mechanism.
  - Holiday/boats: narrator claims ignorance; contrasts castle vs ship.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Discomfort with meat; attentive to companion’s verbal framing.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: continuation of the `N25` interview/papers strand: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md (Westphalian ham + papers) as part of the forecast “commentary… page after page”, and precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md as the next “introduced” subject beat (fallback: treat as overlap-only if the boat/South Africa framing forces a distinct setting).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the Westphalian-ham + paper-reading details are shown to be unrelated, common scene dressing across multiple narrators (no shared interview mechanics beyond food/papers).
- **Research needed:**
  - Clarify the South Africa route reference (if more specific than Union-Castle mail steamers).
