I had always been proud of my namesake, the Great Lexicographer, as we, not unnaturally, called him in the family. But I wondered if part of my life would not rather horribly reverse his. After all he had been born at Colney Hatch. But no, for the goal of my pilgrimage might easily make it Broadmoor ; I rather hated that : portmanteau of Dartmoor and Broad arrows, with a little insanity thrown in. No, locked in, locked in! William the Schoolman---how like an old war song!---was of that place, and, in spite of Rysbrach’s statues of the first Lord King, it was charming. Le couchant dardait ses rayons suprêmes et le vent berçait les nénuphars blêmes ; les grands nénuphars entre les roseaux tristement luisaient sur les calmes eaux. Doctor Invincibilis, dear old Bill, he was no mean psychologist ; he had a razor. There I saw a hen and two sheep. It was a pity about Dickens’ insane jealousy of chickens, and one could really almost weep at his morbid mistrust of sheep.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “the Great Lexicographer” (namesake; likely Dr Samuel Johnson, but confirm).
  - CERTAIN: “William the Schoolman” / “Doctor Invincibilis” / “Bill” (strongly suggests William of Ockham; “razor” = Ockham’s razor).
  - MAYBE: Rysbrach (sculptor reference; “statues of the first Lord King” needs ID).
  - CERTAIN: Dickens (allusive reference; “jealousy of chickens” / mistrust of sheep).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Colney Hatch (asylum reference).
  - CERTAIN: Broadmoor (criminal lunatic asylum; framed as feared destination).
  - CERTAIN: Dartmoor + “Broad arrows” (wordplay offered for “Broadmoor”).
- **Time markers:**
  - MAYBE: evening/sunset (French nénuphars lines).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: French stanza about sunset + water lilies (“nénuphars”) — source TBD.
  - CERTAIN: Ockham’s razor embedded as a joke (“no mean psychologist; he had a razor”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Institutions/confinement: “locked in” + asylum/prison anxieties.
  - Animals: hen + sheep; linked to Dickens allusion.
  - Water lilies / reed-bed imagery.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Dense learned allusion + bilingual quotation; playful etymology/portmanteau.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: same narrator cluster as Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md (shared “Great Lexicographer” anchor + learned diction).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Great Lexicographer” is shown to be someone other than Johnson, or the “razor” joke points to a different “William”.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify French nénuphars stanza source.
  - Identify “Rysbrach’s statues of the first Lord King” and implied location.
  - Confirm which “Great Lexicographer” is intended (and why “born at Colney Hatch”).
