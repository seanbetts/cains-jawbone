Hospitality, when I came to consider it, was indeed a funny thing. I wanted to do my best for this hopeful newcomer. My cellar, my library, my curious collection of bottled worms ; all should be at his disposition. He was pathetically eager. And at the same time, of course, I wanted to do my best for May. I shoed him nearly everything, and he commended all he saw. “You do infinite honour to my little home, Sir Paul,” I said. An old fellow who would be young again! He had only come before lunch ; but there was not time like the present. If it be not now, I somewhat foolishly said to Henry, who gave a slack ear to me, yet it will be. I am not incautious. Determining first to exhibit aconitum, I asked him to take a preliminary glass of sherry. Fleming’s tincture might, and indeed has been, mistaken for this. He drank my health. He tasted love with half his mind, nor ever drank the inviolate spring where nighest heaven.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Sir Paul (likely Sir Paul Trinder; confirm via continuity).
  - CERTAIN: May (named; narrator wants to “do my best for May”).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (present but inattentive; “gave a slack ear”).
  - CERTAIN: narrator/host (keeps a cellar/library/bottled worms collection).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - LIKELY: poisoning setup implied (aconitum exhibited alongside sherry; “I am not incautious”).
- **Means/method:**
  - CERTAIN: aconitum (aconite/wolfsbane; deadly).
  - CERTAIN: Fleming’s tincture (strong tincture of aconite; has been mistaken for “flavored spirit” — Taylor, *A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence* (1897), p. 239): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cugRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA239&dq=Fleming%27s+tincture+of+aconite.
  - CERTAIN: sherry as the immediate drink context.
- **Opportunity:**
  - CERTAIN: in narrator’s home; visitor arrived “before lunch”.
- **Motive (textual):**
  - MAYBE: tied to May (narrator’s obligation/priority to “do my best for May”).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “If it be not now… yet it will be.” (Hamlet phrasing; confirm exact source).
  - CERTAIN: Alfred Tennyson, *In Memoriam* (Canto 88): “He tasted love with half his mind, / Nor ever drank the inviolate spring…” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/In_Memoriam_(Tennyson)/Canto_88
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Naturalist/collector: “bottled worms” collection.
  - Hospitality as cover for exposure to poisons.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: part of `N13` host/guest poisoning run; possible prelude to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md (host administers aconite via sherry → “Next day… for my guest”). Falsifier: `N13` guest on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md/Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md is clearly a different incident/person (female guest + bay house) from “Sir Paul/May/Henry” here.
  - LIKELY: links Sir Paul to the plant/poison method thread.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If aconitum is only being shown as a specimen with no ingestion/administration implied, or if Fleming’s tincture mention is purely didactic.
- **Research needed:**
  - (none)
