It had always been my habit to rise with the lark, if there was one going up at about nine. A confirmed botulist, I first arranged with Flora that there should be seven of the long stout shapes rosily bursting from the exquisite, taut but not too elastic brown at breakfast. I trusted they would not taste of Flora and the country-green. Then with whetted appetite, and after an unsatisfactory visit to the spareroom, I went for a quick stroll among my flowers. If the West African ordeal beans had proved a disappointment, at least the broad ones were giving satisfaction. On that day---and indeed I was well inspired---I discarded my useless physostigma. I led the old mineralogist up the garden, if I may be permitted the expression, and introduced him to my lobelia and to my pretty lords and ladies. I wanted to see how the combination would suit him. I felt I ought to be drawing towards a close ; but one never knew.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Flora (arranged breakfast; likely household staff; not Page 22’s Flora).
  - MAYBE: “old mineralogist” (guest/victim candidate).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: breakfast; “on that day”.
- **Wordplay:**
  - LIKELY: “botulist” (botulism/sausages) as a poison-tinged twist on “botanist”.
  - LIKELY: “led… up the garden” (echoes “up the garden path”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Poisons/plants: West African ordeal beans (physostigma/Calabar bean) vs “the broad ones” (broad beans); lobelia (“Indian tobacco”) and “lords and ladies” (*Arum maculatum*).
  - Food/sausages: “seven… long stout shapes rosily bursting…” (breakfast item; botulism tie).
  - Gardening stroll + “drawing towards a close” suggests a planned end.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Confident poison-botany register; experimental attitude (“see how the combination would suit him”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: extends the plant/poison thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md).
  - MAYBE: links to the mineralogy thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md) via “old mineralogist”.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the plant list is later shown to be harmless gardening chatter with no victimization.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) “the broad ones” are most likely broad beans (*Vicia faba*) (EB1911 “Bean”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bean). Lobelia is likely *Lobelia inflata* (“Indian tobacco”), described as “a typical respiratory poison” (EB1911 “Lobelia”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Lobelia). “Lords and ladies” is *Arum maculatum* (cuckoo-pint / wake robin); aroids contain an “acrid poisonous juice” (EB1911 “Aroideae”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Aroideae).
  - (Unresolved) The “old mineralogist” is not named here; track as `P35` and watch for recurrence/naming (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md repeats “leading the old man up the garden”).
