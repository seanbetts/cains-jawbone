It had always been my habit to rise with the lark, if there was one going up at about nine. A confirmed botulist, I first arranged with Flora that there should be seven of the long stout shapes rosily bursting from the exquisite, taut but not too elastic brown at breakfast. I trusted they would not taste of Flora and the country-green. Then with whetted appetite, and after an unsatisfactory visit to the spareroom, I went for a quick stroll among my flowers. If the West African ordeal beans had proved a disappointment, at least the broad ones were giving satisfaction. On that day---and indeed I was well inspired---I discarded my useless physostigma. I led the old mineralogist up the garden, if I may be permitted the expression, and introduced him to my lobelia and to my pretty lords and ladies. I wanted to see how the combination would suit him. I felt I ought to be drawing towards a close ; but one never knew.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Flora (arranged breakfast; likely household staff; not Page 22’s Flora).
  - MAYBE: “old mineralogist” (guest/victim candidate).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: breakfast; “on that day”.
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: orthography
- span: "botulist"
- reading: "botulist -> botanist/botulism pun (botany voice with food-poisoning shadow)"
- confidence: med
- rationale: The gardening/poison register is immediately tied to breakfast sausages (“botulism” cue) and a flower-stroll.
- falsifier: Later evidence shows “botulist” is an established technical term in-world (no intended pun).

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): orthography
- span: "botulist"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(orthography): botulist = botanist voice coloured by botulism/sausage poisoning"
- confidence: med
- why it matters: narrator -> a compact “botany + food-poison” tell consistent with the experimenter register on this page
- falsifiers:
  - “botulist” is later shown to be purely literal/technical with no punning intent
  - no other similar “near-word” puns appear for this narrator candidate

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: double definition
- span: "led the old mineralogist up the garden"
- reading: "literal leading up the garden + idiom “lead up the garden path” (= deceive)"
- confidence: high
- rationale: “If I may be permitted the expression” signals a deliberate idiom-in-literal-scene overlap while the narrator tests poisonous plant combinations.
- falsifier: The narrator later clarifies they meant only the literal action with no deception/idiom intent.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): double definition
- span: "led the old mineralogist up the garden"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): literal garden-leading + “lead up the garden path” deception (fits the poisoning experiment)"
- confidence: high
- why it matters: motif -> a phrase-level hook that may connect to other “old man up the garden” scenes without implying order
- falsifiers:
  - the “garden path” idiom is absent/irrelevant in this voice’s usage elsewhere
  - later context shows the “old mineralogist” scene is non-deceptive and non-toxic
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Poisons/plants: West African ordeal beans (physostigma/Calabar bean) vs “the broad ones” (broad beans); lobelia (“Indian tobacco”) and “lords and ladies” (*Arum maculatum*).
  - Food/sausages: “seven… long stout shapes rosily bursting…” (breakfast item; botulism tie).
  - Gardening stroll + “drawing towards a close” suggests a planned end.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Confident poison-botany register; experimental attitude (“see how the combination would suit him”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: extends the plant/poison thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md).
  - LIKELY: linked with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md via unique “spare-room/spareroom” house-setting anchor (direction TBD).
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md (Calabar/ordeal-bean “failure” → “discarded… physostigma”).
  - MAYBE: links to the mineralogy thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md) via “old mineralogist”.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the plant list is later shown to be harmless gardening chatter with no victimization.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) “the broad ones” are most likely broad beans (*Vicia faba*) (EB1911 “Bean”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bean). Lobelia is likely *Lobelia inflata* (“Indian tobacco”), described as “a typical respiratory poison” (EB1911 “Lobelia”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Lobelia). “Lords and ladies” is *Arum maculatum* (cuckoo-pint / wake robin); aroids contain an “acrid poisonous juice” (EB1911 “Aroideae”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Aroideae).
  - (Unresolved) The “old mineralogist” is not named here; track as `P35` and watch for recurrence/naming (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md repeats “leading the old man up the garden”).
