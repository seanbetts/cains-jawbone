It had always been my habit to rise with the lark, if there was one going up at about nine. A confirmed botulist, I first arranged with Flora that there should be seven of the long stout shapes rosily bursting from the exquisite, taut but not too elastic brown at breakfast. I trusted they would not taste of Flora and the country-green. Then with whetted appetite, and after an unsatisfactory visit to the spareroom, I went for a quick stroll among my flowers. If the West African ordeal beans had proved a disappointment, at least the broad ones were giving satisfaction. On that day---and indeed I was well inspired---I discarded my useless physostigma. I led the old mineralogist up the garden, if I may be permitted the expression, and introduced him to my lobelia and to my pretty lords and ladies. I wanted to see how the combination would suit him. I felt I ought to be drawing towards a close ; but one never knew.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Flora (arranged breakfast; likely household staff; not Page 22’s Flora).
  - MAYBE: “old mineralogist” (guest/victim candidate).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: breakfast; “on that day”.
- **Wordplay:**
  - LIKELY: “botulist” (botulism/sausages) as a poison-tinged twist on “botanist”.
  - LIKELY: “led… up the garden” (echoes “up the garden path”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Poisons/plants: West African ordeal beans (physostigma/calabar bean), lobelia, “lords and ladies” (Arum).
  - Food/sausages: “seven… long stout shapes rosily bursting…” (breakfast item; botulism tie).
  - Gardening stroll + “drawing towards a close” suggests a planned end.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Confident poison-botany register; experimental attitude (“see how the combination would suit him”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: extends the plant/poison thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md).
  - MAYBE: links to the mineralogy thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md) via “old mineralogist”.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the plant list is later shown to be harmless gardening chatter with no victimization.
- **Research needed:**
  - What are “the broad ones” giving “satisfaction” (broad beans vs another “bean” clue)?
  - Is the “old mineralogist” identifiable (name/title elsewhere)?
