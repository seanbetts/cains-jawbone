For this time being, Henry was drawing towards a close. I was not sorry. The police were after him in no uncertain manner, and it seemed impossible for him to ultimately escape them. While the flying squad had surrounded the house, the locals were thronging the underground passage, and Wellington Crisp, with his assistant and his bulldog, was pouring through the concealed panel in the bathroom. Instead of adding one more to his crimson list, he preferred to trust himself to a limping blimp : almost, it seemed, a certain suicide. But he might return. One never knew. At least my end was reached, and in some comfort. Murders were funny things. If he who so tragically killed his King, ever reached here at all, which is historically more than doubtful (alas, poor Richard! Alas, poor Thomas!) it was certainly not in such ease or such good time as I. I collected myself and mine, and went out to sniff the new air.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - CERTAIN: Wellington Crisp (pursuer); his assistant; his bulldog.
  - CERTAIN: flying squad (police unit).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Police pursuit: surrounded house; underground passage; concealed bathroom panel.
  - Escape attempt: “limping blimp”.
  - “Crimson list” (victim count) + “Murders were funny things.”
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “alas, poor Richard! Alas, poor Thomas!” riffs on Shakespeare’s *Richard II* (York: “Alas, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?”) and Dryden’s *The Mistaken Husband* (“Alas poor Thomas, we must all die!”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9kVwN_5fp_wC&pg=RA1-PA131&dq=%22alas,+poor+Richard%22 ; https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SxAcGP1I6TkC&pg=PA610&dq=%22alas,+poor+Thomas%22
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Darkly comic, thriller-pastiche tone; treats murder as genre mechanics.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md (official knock → flying squad manhunt).
  - MAYBE: Henry narrative escalates from “killings/victim” (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md) to active manhunt (falsifier: if p35 is an embedded/imagined pursuit scenario).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later pages show this is an embedded story/imagined scenario rather than in-world action.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) No external identification found for Wellington Crisp; treat as an in-world detective/pastiche figure unless he is later anchored elsewhere. The “Richard/Thomas” allusion mixes Shakespeare’s “Alas, poor Richard!” (*Richard II*) and Dryden’s “Alas poor Thomas…” (*The Mistaken Husband*) (see citations above).
