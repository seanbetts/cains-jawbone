What was it I held in my fingers? Looked at in one way it could just be a kea. I would give the bird a phoenix chance. I lit a match, and the consequences soothed me. Who was afraid of the big bad wolf? No one, it seemed. His silly bane had now definitely failed. I put, at petit déjeuner, the cast-iron old object on Gelsemium semper-virens. By the by, I had a visit on that day from a detective-sergeant about a poor fellow who had died strangely. My slight experience of detective-sergeants is that they have a manner ; but no plural. If you use a word of more than two syllables to them they think you are laughing at them. They are, to that extent, acute. Still it was awkward with Trinder about. It pleasured me, however, I must confess, to think that I was in a position, though the opportunity was unlikely, to entertain divine Xenocrate with an account of it all.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Trinder (awkward to have him “about”).
  - MAYBE: detective-sergeant (unnamed).
  - MAYBE: Xenocrate (named as “divine”; likely classical reference).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “that day”; “petit déjeuner”.
- **Objects/terms:**
  - CERTAIN: Gelsemium semper-virens (poison plant; yellow jasmine).
  - MAYBE: “cast-iron old object” (set on the plant at breakfast).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Poison attempt failure: “His silly bane had now definitely failed.”
  - Matches: lights a match; “consequences soothed me.”
  - Animal/bird wordplay: kea/phoenix chance.
  - Police attention: detective-sergeant visit re “died strangely”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Arch, punning; disdain for detective-sergeants’ vocabulary tolerance.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: connects to Sir Paul Trinder pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md) and to a Trinder-outcome page (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md).
  - CERTAIN: strengthens plant/poison thread via explicit gelsemium.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Trinder” here is unrelated to Sir Paul Trinder, or gelsemium context is non-poisonous/ornamental.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify what the “cast-iron” object is and why it’s placed on gelsemium.
  - Identify the Xenocrate reference and whether it recurs.
