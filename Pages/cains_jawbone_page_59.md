What was it I held in my fingers? Looked at in one way it could just be a kea. I would give the bird a phoenix chance. I lit a match, and the consequences soothed me. Who was afraid of the big bad wolf? No one, it seemed. His silly bane had now definitely failed. I put, at petit déjeuner, the cast-iron old object on Gelsemium semper-virens. By the by, I had a visit on that day from a detective-sergeant about a poor fellow who had died strangely. My slight experience of detective-sergeants is that they have a manner ; but no plural. If you use a word of more than two syllables to them they think you are laughing at them. They are, to that extent, acute. Still it was awkward with Trinder about. It pleasured me, however, I must confess, to think that I was in a position, though the opportunity was unlikely, to entertain divine Xenocrate with an account of it all.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Trinder (awkward to have him “about”).
  - MAYBE: detective-sergeant (unnamed).
  - MAYBE: Xenocrate (named as “divine”; likely classical reference).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “that day”; “petit déjeuner”.
- **Objects/terms:**
  - CERTAIN: kea (New Zealand mountain parrot, *Nestor notabilis*; “assaulting sheep” reputation in EB1911 “Nestor”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Nestor_(parrot)
  - CERTAIN: Gelsemium semper-virens (Carolina/wild yellow jessamine; contains alkaloids gelsemine/gelseminine; described as a nerve poison and can kill by respiratory arrest in EB1911 “Gelsemium”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Gelsemium
  - MAYBE: “cast-iron old object” (a small cast-iron bird/ornament described as a “kea”; function unclear).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Poison attempt failure: “His silly bane had now definitely failed.”
  - Matches: lights a match; “consequences soothed me.”
  - Animal/bird wordplay: kea/phoenix chance.
  - Police attention: detective-sergeant visit re “died strangely”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Arch, punning; disdain for detective-sergeants’ vocabulary tolerance.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: connects to Sir Paul Trinder pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md) and to a Trinder-outcome page (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md).
  - CERTAIN: strengthens plant/poison thread via explicit gelsemium.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Trinder” here is unrelated to Sir Paul Trinder, or gelsemium context is non-poisonous/ornamental.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify what the “cast-iron” object is (beyond “kea” bird-shape) and why it’s placed on gelsemium.
  - Identify the Xenocrate reference and whether it recurs.
