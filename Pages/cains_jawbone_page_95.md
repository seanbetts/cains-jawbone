I knew, of course, that if I got there in five minutes I would have double the time for my by no means suburban hops at the Café Royal, without insulting it and myself with John Montagu’s arrangement for an uninterrupted session at the gaming table. I felt so much at one with Holy Mr. Herbert. Or Mr. Haddock did he call himself? But he was right about these hours, and if that was not holiness, what was? Meed kissing laces, surely he had convulsed us with. For the moment it didn’t matter. Because I had decided what to do. Leda and Hebe, I gave my swan a drink, and then drew a sheet of notepaper towards me. I took up my pen, after having laid it down again and again, and, seeing that the ink was sufficient, plunged in. In clear terse phrase, utterly neglecting my contact with his infancy, I told him all, hour by hour, day by day, from the inception to the culmination of the horrid act.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”; time-planning, then letter-writing).
  - CERTAIN: “him” (recipient of narrator’s written account).
  - CERTAIN: John Montagu (Earl of Sandwich; allusion to the “sandwich” origin story).
  - LIKELY: “my swan” = Swan (fountain pen/ink); “gave my swan a drink” = inking/filling the pen.
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Café Royal (explicit; time-hop destination).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “in five minutes”.
  - CERTAIN: “hour by hour, day by day” timeline in the written account.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Holy Mr. Herbert” is Izaak Walton’s epithet for George Herbert in *The Complete Angler* (5th ed.), Chapter V (“Come let me tell you what holy Mr. Herbert says of such days and flowers as these”), quoting Herbert’s “Vertue” (“Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright…”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Angler,_5th_edition/Chapter_V. (“Mr. Haddock” / “Meed kissing laces” remain unresolved.)
  - LIKELY: “Leda and Hebe” are mythic wordplay for “swan + drink”: Leda is visited by Zeus “in the form of a swan” (EB1911 “Leda”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Leda) and Hebe “acts as cupbearer to the gods” (EB1911 “Hebe”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Hebe) → fits “gave my swan a drink” (inking the pen). Cf. “Swan” used as a fountain-pen ink name in *The Loudwater Mystery* (Chapter 16): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Loudwater_Mystery/Chapter_16.
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: allusion
- span: "Leda and Hebe, I gave my swan a drink"
- reading: "Leda -> swan; Hebe -> cupbearer -> (swan + drink) -> fill/ink Swan pen"
- confidence: high
- rationale: The mythic pair cleanly maps to “swan + drink”, and the surrounding context is explicitly pen/ink + letter-writing.
- falsifier: If “my swan” is later clearly literal (bird) or the narrator’s writing/pen context collapses.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): allusion + charade
- span: "Leda and Hebe, I gave my swan a drink"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(allusion): Leda (swan) + Hebe (cupbearer) -> “swan a drink” = inking/filling a Swan fountain pen"
- confidence: high
- why it matters: motif -> writing/pen/ink ritual marker for this narrator segment
- falsifiers:
  - no other stationery/letter-writing cues appear in adjacent pages for this voice
  - “Swan” never recurs as a pen/ink brand/motif elsewhere
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - MAYBE: “the horrid act” described from inception to culmination (could be crime confession/report; outcome unspecified).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Time budgeting (minutes; “double the time”) + gaming-table allusion.
  - CERTAIN: “John Montagu’s arrangement for an uninterrupted session at the gaming table” = the sandwich (named from the Earl of Sandwich; origin-story: invented so he could remain at the gaming table): Webster 1913 “Sandwich” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Sandwich); *The Past at Our Doors* (1911), “The Story of Our Food” (https://ia601501.us.archive.org/33/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.84533/2015.84533.The-Past-At-Our-Doors-Or-The-Old-In-The-New-Around-Us_djvu.txt).
  - Writing/ink/pen ritual (repeatedly laying pen down; checking ink; “plunged in”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Decision-point framing (“I had decided what to do”) followed by procedural recounting.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “horrid act” is later shown to be non-violent (e.g., fraud/prank) rather than murder.
- **Research needed:**
  - STALLED: No direct pre-1934 match found yet for “Mr. Haddock” or the exact “Meed kissing laces” phrase (see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
