I knew, of course, that if I got there in five minutes I would have double the time for my by no means suburban hops at the Café Royal, without insulting it and myself with John Montagu’s arrangement for an uninterrupted session at the gaming table. I felt so much at one with Holy Mr. Herbert. Or Mr. Haddock did he call himself? But he was right about these hours, and if that was not holiness, what was? Meed kissing laces, surely he had convulsed us with. For the moment it didn’t matter. Because I had decided what to do. Leda and Hebe, I gave my swan a drink, and then drew a sheet of notepaper towards me. I took up my pen, after having laid it down again and again, and, seeing that the ink was sufficient, plunged in. In clear terse phrase, utterly neglecting my contact with his infancy, I told him all, hour by hour, day by day, from the inception to the culmination of the horrid act.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”; time-planning, then letter-writing).
  - MAYBE: “Holy Mr. Herbert” / “Mr. Haddock” (identity unclear; referenced approvingly).
  - CERTAIN: “him” (recipient of narrator’s written account).
  - MAYBE: John Montagu (referenced via “arrangement… at the gaming table”; likely allusive).
  - MAYBE: “my swan” (LIKELY the pen; “gave my swan a drink”).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Café Royal (explicit; time-hop destination).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “in five minutes”.
  - CERTAIN: “hour by hour, day by day” timeline in the written account.
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - MAYBE: “the horrid act” described from inception to culmination (could be crime confession/report; outcome unspecified).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Time budgeting (minutes; “double the time”) + gaming-table allusion.
  - Writing/ink/pen ritual (repeatedly laying pen down; checking ink; “plunged in”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Decision-point framing (“I had decided what to do”) followed by procedural recounting.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “horrid act” is later shown to be non-violent (e.g., fraud/prank) rather than murder.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify “Holy Mr. Herbert” / “Mr. Haddock” and the “Meed kissing laces” reference.
  - Clarify the Café Royal / John Montagu/gaming-table allusion.
  - Determine what “Leda and Hebe” and “my swan” refer to (pen brand? mythic wordplay?).
