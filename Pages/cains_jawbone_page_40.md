What chemistry! That the winds are really not infectious. Now that I was approaching journey’s end, I began to ask myself disconcerting questions. It would be terrible if she turned out to be Flecker’s one. And some to Flecker turn to pray, and I toward thy bed. But I had probably got it wrong. Yet it was all right. Her spelling was different and it was long ago. Yes, but supposing she came of the family of Jack’s visitor, with Thornhill, who promised the opera? I could never be sure of that. I took a pill. But it was worth it. Yes, it was worth it. The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden. He certainly could put that sort of thing over, the dear old bean. Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato’s dark green leaves. Thames Ditton’s sister, as Eric Parker calls her---and one remembered the Irishman’s malapropism in the same tale---had soon passed. Long she was ; but I did not linger to pay court to her.

## Notes

- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “And some to Flecker turn to pray, and I toward thy bed.” (source/allusion TBD).
  - CERTAIN: Walt Whitman, “This Compost” (*Leaves of Grass*, “Autumn Rivulets”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass_(1882)/Autumn_Rivulets/This_Compost (includes “What chemistry! That the winds are really not infectious” + the bean/potato growth lines quoted here).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Pill-taking (“I took a pill… it was worth it”).
  - Gardening growth imagery: bean bursting; potato leaves.
  - Place wordplay: “Thames Ditton’s sister… Long she was” implies Long Ditton.
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Thames Ditton; LIKELY: Long Ditton.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Dense allusive, punning; uses place-nickname logic.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: pill + bean/garden growth links to plant/poison thread pages.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Thames Ditton’s sister” is not meant literally (Long Ditton) or doesn’t recur.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the Flecker line/source and the “Jack’s visitor / Thornhill / opera” reference.
  - Identify the Eric Parker “Thames Ditton’s sister” tale + the Irishman’s malapropism.
