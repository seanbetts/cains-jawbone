One’s eyebrows were one’s own, I always thought. Though I did remember a case---Aunt Mary’s, to be precise---when it was not so. She had met him after the explosion, of course ; and when it became a question of dinner and the Highgate Empire, actually with performing quaggas, she put herself in the hands of the man who made up for, if anything could make up for, the Russian ballet. And they dropped, naturally, like two fuzzy caterpillars into the clear soup at supper. The old days. The Highgate Empire, where Wilkie Bard, as Lauder did not say, sang o’ his love and fondly sae did I o’ mine. At last the two little horrors ceased in their shrill claim and counter-claim for sweaty quasi-transparencies of colour, and goggled at me while I put black to mine. Bill always called them two dark flapper moons. Should I make an effort and go back to Henry? He was ready to love. That at least was obvious.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Aunt Mary (lost eyebrows “after the explosion”).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (romantic target; “ready to love”).
  - MAYBE: Bill (names the eyebrows “two dark flapper moons”).
  - CERTAIN: Highgate Empire (venue); Russian ballet (reference).
  - CERTAIN: Wilkie Bard; (Sir Harry) Lauder (music-hall references).
  - MAYBE: “man who made up for… the Russian ballet” (make-up artist).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “sang o’ his love and fondly sae did I o’ mine” (song/lyric; source TBD).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Eyebrows/cosmetics: false eyebrows as “fuzzy caterpillars”; applying black.
  - Theatre/music-hall + supper: eyebrow mishap “into the clear soup”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Stage/cosmetics knowingness; nostalgic (“The old days”); romantic vacillation about Henry.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: cosmetics/social-voice cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md (powdered nose) and Henry-threads.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later pages show this Henry is clearly different from other Henry scenes.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the lyric “fondly sae did I o’ mine” and whether it anchors a date/performer.
