What should such a man need with such a companion, I asked myself. And then I thought of Jim’s uncle, Darius Brockley, and of the flimsy excuse the Vicar’s niece had given when she returned. Yes, I began to understand. And I was not sorry to dissociate the last of the gold from the silver, and wait upon events. I stretched out my hand and touched a dime shape on the chair beside me ; a sleek cat that horribly exulted at the touch of my fingers. We were told that the human heart was deceitful and desperately wicked ; what then should be said of the human mind? Why, I meant, should I have remembered the tale of the Major-General in Trafalgar Square on Guy Fawkes night, and how the dead man had told it me, just an hour before...they came to take him away? And then how about myself? Admittedly I was a warrior, but even I, surely, could be a warrior without being a bounder.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Jim (unnamed; referenced via “Jim’s uncle”).
  - CERTAIN: Darius Brockley (Jim’s uncle).
  - CERTAIN: “the Vicar’s niece” (unnamed).
  - CERTAIN: “the dead man” (unnamed; told narrator a story shortly before being “taken away”).
  - LIKELY: Major-General statue at Trafalgar Square is Sir Henry Havelock (Kelly’s *Post Office Guide to London in 1871* (1871), p. 334: “HAVELOCK.— A bronze statue, in Trafalgar-square, by Behnes.”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0VO7Grn7tAkC&pg=PA334&dq=Trafalgar+Square+Havelock.
  - CERTAIN: sleek cat (on chair beside narrator).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: Guy Fawkes night (Nov 5) at Trafalgar Square (anecdote anchor).
  - CERTAIN: “just an hour before… they came to take him away” (tight relative timing).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “the human heart was deceitful and desperately wicked” (Jeremiah 17:9).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Money/coins: “gold” vs “silver”; “dime shape”.
  - Deceit/mind vs heart; waiting “upon events”.
  - Removal/custody implied (“take him away”) + subsequent death.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-justifying tone (“warrior… without being a bounder”); suspicion/interpretation of others’ motives.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to other “removed/arrested/locked in” threads (asylum/police); hold until more anchors.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “dead man” is metaphorical or purely a quoted/storytold figure rather than an in-world death.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the specific “Major-General in Trafalgar Square on Guy Fawkes night” anecdote, if it exists in a source text (statue likely Sir Henry Havelock; see Kelly’s *Post Office Guide to London in 1871* (1871), p. 334): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0VO7Grn7tAkC&pg=PA334&dq=Trafalgar+Square+Havelock.
  - STALLED: no pre-1934 source/allusion match found yet for “Darius Brockley” / “Vicar’s niece”; treat as in-world names unless a fuller quotation recurs.
  - Clarify what “dissociate the last of the gold from the silver” refers to (coin sorting? figurative?).
