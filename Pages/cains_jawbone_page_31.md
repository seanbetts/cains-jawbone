The others did not seem similarly impressed. Phrases of this and that came to half my ear, duet by rill and corncrake. Rill vaunted the pleasure of speeding, and corncrake gave warnings like an over-driven oak about to fall. I remembered how I had listened for the same sound on that awful night in Paris, when I did not know what I know now. And again, in this very place for another reason, Henry would remember. To lose even two like these two, swallowed by the night, was apt to break a balance in one, to suggest that it was time to square accounts. Caseus, ah! And nothing lean or hungry here at all. A friend in the nick of time. I would have no more. My hand dropped to my hip pocket. I had to reckon with Henry. Yet could I? This nomenclature business had often bothered me. Sometimes I felt sudden enough, as if my head would burst  sometimes but triturative. Was I a bomb, or only slow and godly and exceeding small?

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - CERTAIN: Paris.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - LIKELY: “nothing lean or hungry” alludes to Cassius (“lean and hungry look”) (Julius Caesar).
- **Wordplay:**
  - LIKELY: “Caseus, ah!” (Latin *caseus* = cheese) as a Cassius soundalike / nomenclature joke (reinforced by the nearby Julius Caesar “lean and hungry” hint).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Threat/weapon: “hand dropped to my hip pocket”.
  - “Square accounts” / settling scores.
  - Sound motif: “rill and corncrake” as a duet (smooth running vs warning “crake/creak”) tied to “speeding” → likely vehicle/engine/chassis sounds.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Fixation on naming (“nomenclature business”); oscillates between suddenness vs “triturative” slowness (bomb vs “exceeding small”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: connects to other Henry “reckon with Henry” pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Caseus”/Cassius reading doesn’t recur and “hip pocket” is purely idiomatic (not weapon).
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) “rill and corncrake” reads as a metaphor for speeding: smooth-running sound vs warning “crake/creak” (vehicle/engine/chassis rather than literal nature).
  - (Resolved) No unique external event/source match identified for “that awful night in Paris” from the wording alone; treat as narrator backstory unless later tied to a specific date/name.
