I rubbed my eyes and massaged my temples with pronated finger-tips. Then I fumbled two aspirin tablets into my mouth : Noel Coward’s King Charles’s Head. I had a very bad head. My vis-à-vis hadn’t a bad head, now I came to consider it, bowed over the documents. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case. I became a trifle abstracted. What, I wondered, would he have said about an abstracted will? He might answer to the same name as the man who sang : “Ah, are you digging on my grave?” But a softer fellow I had rarely seen. On velvet, yes, on velvet I would have trusted him ; but not on cinders, by no means on cinders. Yet the keen eyes bent like small topaz searchlights over the writing. I would get, I felt, what I wanted from this man. But then I suddenly remembered the words of the poet :


        The golden one is gone from the banquets,
        She, beloved of Atimetus,

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: vis-à-vis (male; reading “documents”; likely connected to a will).
  - CERTAIN: Noel Coward (reference).
- **Time markers:**
  - MAYBE: “bad head” day (medical state; no explicit date).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Ah, are you digging on my grave?” (Thomas Hardy poem; “man who sang” = setting/performer unknown).
  - CERTAIN: “The golden one is gone from the banquets… beloved of Atimetus” — Greek Anthology epigram “On Claudia Homonoea” (author unknown); Atimetus is correct (not Admetus). Cf. J.W. Mackail, *Select Epigrams from the Greek Anthology* (1890), Epigram XLIII: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2378
  - LIKELY: “Noel Coward’s King Charles’s Head” — “King Charles’s head” is a Dickens allusion/idiom for a fixed idea/obsession (Mr. Dick in *David Copperfield*); used here as a pun on “bad head” + aspirin. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: double definition
- span: "abstracted will"
- reading: "abstracted (distracted) + abstracted (stolen / reduced to an abstract) applied to “will”"
- confidence: high
- rationale: The narrator becomes “abstracted” while watching a man bent over legal documents; the “will” is foregrounded in the same breath.
- falsifier: Later context forces “abstracted” to mean only “distracted” with no document-theft/abstract sense in play.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): double definition
- span: "abstracted will"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): abstracted will = distracted about a will + a will abstracted/stolen/abstracted"
- confidence: high
- why it matters: motif -> reinforces the will/document manipulation thread used for clustering (without implying sequence)
- falsifiers:
  - “abstracted” is later shown to be purely emotional distraction language for this voice
  - the “will” in this scene is proven not to be a legal document (metaphorical usage)
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Documents/wills; privacy (cigarette case); topaz “searchlight” eyes.
  - Trust test: “velvet” vs “cinders”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Legal/estate language + social niceties; opportunistic (“get what I wanted”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md (will-talk to May + spilled wine → this “bad head” document scene; see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N10` block).
  - MAYBE: paired with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md more loosely as a will/document motif cluster if the scenes prove distinct.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Page 14’s “leave everything” is unrelated (different people/context).
- **Research needed:**
  - None.
