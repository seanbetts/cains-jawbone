I rubbed my eyes and massaged my temples with pronated finger-tips. Then I fumbled two aspirin tablets into my mouth : Noel Coward’s King Charles’s Head. I had a very bad head. My vis-à-vis hadn’t a bad head, now I came to consider it, bowed over the documents. It is a very ungentlemanly thing to read a private cigarette case. I became a trifle abstracted. What, I wondered, would he have said about an abstracted will? He might answer to the same name as the man who sang : “Ah, are you digging on my grave?” But a softer fellow I had rarely seen. On velvet, yes, on velvet I would have trusted him ; but not on cinders, by no means on cinders. Yet the keen eyes bent like small topaz searchlights over the writing. I would get, I felt, what I wanted from this man. But then I suddenly remembered the words of the poet :


        The golden one is gone from the banquets,
        She, beloved of Atimetus,

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: vis-à-vis (male; reading “documents”; likely connected to a will).
  - CERTAIN: Noel Coward (reference).
- **Time markers:**
  - MAYBE: “bad head” day (medical state; no explicit date).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Ah, are you digging on my grave?” (Thomas Hardy poem; “man who sang” = setting/performer unknown).
  - CERTAIN: “The golden one is gone from the banquets… beloved of Atimetus” — Greek Anthology epigram “On Claudia Homonoea” (author unknown); Atimetus is correct (not Admetus). Cf. J.W. Mackail, *Select Epigrams from the Greek Anthology* (1890), Epigram XLIII: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2378
  - LIKELY: “Noel Coward’s King Charles’s Head” — “King Charles’s head” is a Dickens allusion/idiom for a fixed idea/obsession (Mr. Dick in *David Copperfield*); used here as a pun on “bad head” + aspirin. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766
- **Wordplay:**
  - LIKELY: “abstracted” → “abstracted will” (legal pun).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Documents/wills; privacy (cigarette case); topaz “searchlight” eyes.
  - Trust test: “velvet” vs “cinders”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Legal/estate language + social niceties; opportunistic (“get what I wanted”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: will/inheritance cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md (overheard “leave everything to me… May”).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Page 14’s “leave everything” is unrelated (different people/context).
- **Research needed:**
  - None.
