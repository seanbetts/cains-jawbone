I was a little consoled for the weeping weather by the fact that Gainsborough had gone out to-day. And, now I came to think of it, Henry had also gone to-day ; poor Henry, who had stayed uncomfortably after his meeting with Clément yesterday. Henceforth I ask not good fortune, I myself am good fortune, I changed. Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing, done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms. But that would be scanned. Or rather it wouldn’t. It didn’t seem to fit. I had woken that morning pleasantly near the sea, at yesterday’s capricious place of appointment with the man who gave me my instructions and all I wanted beside. Did Wodehouse know it, I wondered. Of its Earl he had said that he stood gazing out over his domain, drooping like a wet sock, as was his habit when he had nothing to prop his spine against. All I wanted beside, I had thought. Hadn’t Chesterton said something about it’s being hemp at both ends? My job might prove him right.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Gainsborough (Thomas Gainsborough; used as “gone out to-day” death-date anchor).
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - CERTAIN: Clément (named; Henry met him “yesterday”).
  - CERTAIN: Walt Whitman (quote).
  - CERTAIN: P. G. Wodehouse; G. K. Chesterton (references).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day” (Gainsborough + Henry “gone”).
  - CERTAIN: “yesterday” (Henry met Clément; sea-side appointment).
  - LIKELY: “Gainsborough had gone out to-day” → Aug 2 (Gainsborough’s death date; EB1911).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Henceforth I ask not good fortune, I myself am good fortune…” (Whitman, free verse; “wouldn’t scan” comment).
  - CERTAIN: Wodehouse: “drooping like a wet sock… nothing to prop his spine against” (Earl of Emsworth; *Leave It to Psmith*, “Dark Plottings at Blandings Castle”).
  - CERTAIN: Chesterton: “hemp at both ends” (in a hashish discussion; *The Flying Inn*, Ch. XXII).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Near-sea appointment with “the man who gave me my instructions” (mission/job framing).
  - Poetry-scansion awareness (uses “scanned” as a test).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Literate, self-critical about fit/metrics; suggests a “job” with ominous outcome (“hemp”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md (both hinge on a key “yesterday” instructions meeting; p32 reads like morning-after reflection, p3 like on-the-road execution; Sequence A in `Order/hypotheses.md`’s `N03` block).
  - MAYBE: Henry↔Clément continuity thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md), pending whether Henry is the same participant across these pages.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Gainsborough gone out” is later shown to mean travel/departure rather than a death-date anchor.
- **Research needed:**
  - None (resolved Gainsborough/Wodehouse/Chesterton allusions).
