At my meeting with Clement yesterday, he had been quite specific : less than twenty thousand yards as average---seventeen thousand six hundred to be exact---full ration of the assassin’s wonderful substance, a little act of justice at the end of less than a week, and then the glorious stuff galore for ever. I felt excellent as I took my second pill. At least I was on my way, for I had come upon the major half of a publishing firm ; they had always been very good to me, what with Austin Freeman, Oppenheim and Mary Roberts Rinehart. O my mother was loath to have her go away, all the week she thought of her, she watched for her many a month. And then there was a forgotten line. But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again. I thought it a pity that Hodder was not there : what a sweet name for a village! My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes. No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair. I have no chair.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Clement (met “yesterday”); narrator taking pills; “major half” of a publishing firm.
  - CERTAIN: Austin Freeman; E. Phillips Oppenheim; Mary Roberts Rinehart (authors referenced).
  - CERTAIN: “major half of a publishing firm” points to Stoughton (as in Hodder & Stoughton); “Hodder” is the missing other half (publisher clue).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: met Clement yesterday; “end of less than a week”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “O my mother was loth to have her go away… / …But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.” — Walt Whitman, “The Sleepers” (*Leaves of Grass*, 1882): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass_(1882)/The_Sleepers.
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: charade
- span: "major half of a publishing firm"
- reading: "major half of a publishing firm -> Stoughton (Hodder & Stoughton)"
- confidence: high
- rationale: The phrase points to the larger half of “Hodder & Stoughton”, matching the nearby “Hodder” mention.
- falsifier: Later context identifies the publishing firm as something other than Hodder & Stoughton.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): charade
- span: "major half of a publishing firm"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(charade): major half of a publishing firm -> Stoughton (implying Hodder & Stoughton)"
- confidence: high
- why it matters: narrator -> a distinctive publishing-world clue that can help cluster this voice’s business/literary register
- falsifiers:
  - the “publishing firm” is later identified as a different firm pairing
  - “major half” is used literally (ownership), not as a clue
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Numeric precision: “seventeen thousand six hundred yards” = 10 miles exactly (1760 yd/mile).
  - Pills / “assassin’s wonderful substance”: LIKELY hashish/hasheesh, per EB1911’s etymology of “assassin” as “Hashīshīn, from Hashish” (and note that fedais “were intoxicated with the hashīsh”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Assassin.
  - Publishing-world references; travel readiness (“rain-proof coat, good shoes”); “I have no chair.”
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Transactional, self-satisfied tone; mixes commerce (publishers) with menace (assassin substance).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md nearby (both hinge on a key “yesterday” instructions meeting + job framing; Sequence A in `Order/hypotheses.md`’s `N03` block).
  - MAYBE: Clement/Clément/Clem continuity across Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md (pending disambiguation: Clement-as-met-person vs Clement-as-narrator-name clue).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later context shows “pills” are benign/medical and “assassin” is figurative.
- **Research needed:**
  - RESOLVED: “assassin’s wonderful substance” is LIKELY hashish; 17,600 yards = 10 miles (see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
