At my meeting with Clement yesterday, he had been quite specific : less than twenty thousand yards as average---seventeen thousand six hundred to be exact---full ration of the assassin’s wonderful substance, a little act of justice at the end of less than a week, and then the glorious stuff galore for ever. I felt excellent as I took my second pill. At least I was on my way, for I had come upon the major half of a publishing firm ; they had always been very good to me, what with Austin Freeman, Oppenheim and Mary Roberts Rinehart. O my mother was loath to have her go away, all the week she thought of her, she watched for her many a month. And then there was a forgotten line. But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again. I thought it a pity that Hodder was not there : what a sweet name for a village! My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes. No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair. I have no chair.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Clement (met “yesterday”); narrator taking pills; “major half” of a publishing firm.
  - CERTAIN: Austin Freeman; E. Phillips Oppenheim; Mary Roberts Rinehart (authors referenced).
  - MAYBE: “Hodder” = person at the publishing firm vs place-name noted as “a village”.
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: met Clement yesterday; “end of less than a week”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “O my mother was loath to have her go away…” / “the red squaw never came…” (source TBD).
- **Wordplay:**
  - LIKELY: “seventeen thousand six hundred yards” = 10 miles exactly (1760 yd/mile) — intentional precision.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Pills / “assassin’s wonderful substance” (poison/drug?); promised “stuff… for ever”.
  - Publishing-world references; travel readiness (“rain-proof coat, good shoes”); “I have no chair.”
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Transactional, self-satisfied tone; mixes commerce (publishers) with menace (assassin substance).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: belongs with other pill/poison pages (track “wonderful substance” and Clement across the book).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later context shows “pills” are benign/medical and “assassin” is figurative.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the “red squaw” quotation.
  - Identify the publishing firm implied by the author list (and whether “Hodder” is the clue).
  - Identify “assassin’s wonderful substance” (hashish/other?) in period usage.
