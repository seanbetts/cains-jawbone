I saw to it that I should be for a moment alone among the marigolds. Thinking kindly of those two other flowers, which I felt almost certain now would win me the girl I felt I could love, I exulted. Dear old Gerard, he said it was called Calendula as it is to be seene to flower in the calends of almost everie month. I turned the strong searchlights of my eyes upon the orange tinted documents. But I could not read them. My eyes, or something, were not good enough. And yet I was not among those who attempt, ek parergou, to confound ephphatha with epea pteroenta. You would have noticed my oriental preference when I smoke, and would not have been surprised that my Indian tobacco, after a scant four-and-twenty hours, was doing excellent work. It seemed almost certain that the blight would be destroyed : the blight on the May, or on the delight that is as wide-eyed as a marigold.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “the girl” (unnamed; narrator believes flowers will “win” her).
  - MAYBE: May (person vs hawthorn/“May” plant; referenced as the site of “blight”).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: John Gerard (*Herball*) on calendula/marigold flowering “in the calends of almost everie month” (quoted/paraphrased).
  - MAYBE: “ephphatha” vs “epea pteroenta” (philological joke; Mark 7:34 vs Homeric “winged words”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Flowers: marigolds / calendula; plus “two other flowers” (implied red/white from adjacent pages).
  - Documents: “orange tinted documents” (possibly linked to the secret purchases mentioned on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md).
  - Eyes/vision: cannot read documents; “searchlights of my eyes” fail.
  - Tobacco/plant remedies: “Indian tobacco” (likely lobelia) doing “excellent work” after ~24 hours; blight being destroyed.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Botanically literate; mixes classical/philological flexing with practical horticulture and courtship strategy.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: pairs with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md (eyes + secret “them” + flowers/documents) within a single narrator segment.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “documents” are unrelated to Page 74’s “them”, and the blight is purely metaphorical.
- **Research needed:**
  - Confirm what “Indian tobacco” refers to here (lobelia vs another product) and whether it’s used as a pesticide/cure.
  - Clarify whether “May” is a person or the hawthorn/May-blossom plant.
