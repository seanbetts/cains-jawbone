I was feeling about as good as man could feel that day. Everything horticultural, in the awful and literal sense of the word, was lovely. Green blood, as I considered before breakfast, I delighted to conserve. I received a letter from Miss Doncaster over the crumbs of toast and the last clear smear of marmalade, telling me that the old man would be coming to-day, on her advice to take mine. I admit that she had stirred me strangely. I lit a Nestor and considered her letter once more. To pestle a poisoned poison behind his crimson lights. That was a nice thing to ask of a comparative stranger. It would have to be scanned. Poor old man ; but everyone must bump up against his Waterloo, and to-day was the day of the meeting at La Belle Alliance. It was not appropriate.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Miss Doncaster (letter-writer).
  - MAYBE: “old man” (coming “to-day”; on her advice).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “before breakfast”; “to-day”.
  - CERTAIN: “to-day… meeting at La Belle Alliance” → Waterloo day = June 18, 1815 (Nuttall Encyclopaedia, “Waterloo”).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: La Belle Alliance (Waterloo reference point).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Plant/poison work: “everything horticultural… lovely”; “Green blood… conserve”.
  - Preparation/poisoning: “pestle a poisoned poison behind his crimson lights” (eyes?).
  - Smoking: “lit a Nestor”.
  - Scansion habit: “It would have to be scanned.”
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Horticultural precision + moral irony; plans violence with literary/metrical framing.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: strengthens plant/poison thread pages.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “poisoned poison” and “crimson lights” resolve to non-lethal horticulture/wordplay with no victim.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the “pestle a poisoned poison…” line source (if quoted).
  - Identify Nestor (cigarette brand) details if it recurs as a tell.
