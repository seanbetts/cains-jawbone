Of course I was sorry to say good-bye to old Medehamstede ; but it was pleasant to sit down and to really find myself alone at last. Those emotional times were trying to us all. I felt that my lips were paler than I liked ; but a touch of Pasquier’s claret soon put me right. Dear old Pasquier, I had come across him in Paris, at that little place in the Rue de la Harpe, a street in which, I have been told, there was a touch of orderly room even in the disorderly houses. I opened a magazine and looked hastily through the last paragraphs of the short stories. I was all for love ; but fading out on an embrace never appealed to me. The embrace in my short stories---and my life was all short stories, I had come to think---occurred in the first few words. And afterwards the plot. The complete novel length looked better. It was called Savage Conqueror, and I liked that.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Pasquier (associated with claret; narrator knows him from Paris).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Paris; Rue de la Harpe.
  - MAYBE: “old Medehamstede” (place-name; likely historical/monastic; confirm intended referent).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Drink: claret as remedy for pallor.
  - Reading/writing: narrator skims endings of short stories; prefers embrace first, plot after.
  - Title anchor: “Savage Conqueror” (novel length; potentially a clue text).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Meta-fictional, cynical about romance conventions; self-identifies life as “short stories”.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to other “papers/magazine/story” narrators; hold until more anchors.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Pasquier” is a brand/product rather than an in-world acquaintance.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify what/where “Medehamstede” points to in this context.
  - Identify “Savage Conqueror” (author/date) and whether it’s being used as an ordering/cipher key.
  - Identify Pasquier (wine-merchant/brand) if traceable.
