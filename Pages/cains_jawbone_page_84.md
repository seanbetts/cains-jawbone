I wish she would tell me more. I wish she would give me some hint as to why the deceased wished us to know each other. Sitting here, stung by those wild gold waspish eyes, I wonder terribly. I wonder dreadfully. I do think it is a pity. Auroral imbibitious have set Alistair on young uncertain feet once more, and he’s handsomely taken the Dagenham bus en route for the converted oast-house where his mother lives. I hope it won’t backslide. Barbara passes from right to left, dear child. Her one-piece is yellow jasmine, and she spurns the concrete and especially the abstract with those bronze legs of hers. The tawny curls of her are springes to catch woodcocks, and more than woodcocks. She waves a towel capriciously, take it or leave it, at me. What would I do now, if the other leaned across and said what the blind sailor said? But wiseacres contend that it was Kismet. Off went his arm to-day. Yes, what would I feel like? She is delightful.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “she” (unnamed; “wild gold waspish eyes”).
  - CERTAIN: “the deceased” (unnamed; arranged acquaintance; context suggests in-world death).
  - CERTAIN: Alistair (takes the Dagenham bus to mother’s oast-house).
  - CERTAIN: Barbara (young; in a yellow-jasmine one-piece; waves a towel).
  - MAYBE: “the other” (someone who might “lean across and [say] what the blind sailor said”).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Dagenham (bus reference).
  - MAYBE: converted oast-house (mother’s home; location unspecified).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day” (someone’s arm “off… to-day”; likely a calendar anchor).
  - LIKELY: morning drinking implied (“Auroral imbibitious”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Death-driven introduction (“why the deceased wished us to know each other”).
  - Bathing/leisure imagery (one-piece; towel).
  - Fate framing (Kismet) + amputation reference.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Rapturous description of Barbara; anxious curiosity about the deceased’s motive.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “deceased” is metaphorical (e.g., a dead author) rather than in-world person.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the “blind sailor” quote being referenced.
  - Identify whose arm went off “to-day” and whether it encodes a date.
  - Identify what “Kismet” is pointing to in this context (play/film/allusion vs pure fate word).
