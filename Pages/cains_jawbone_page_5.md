I hated my eye for being caught by what didn’t concern me : the powerful grip of the new young man. But it was parading a couple of letters for all to see. Thomas Hardy had been, and my doctor uncle in the war had been just the reverse. And I would have to cut out the stops, I realised futilely, for something vaguely Buddhistic. He went on about Browning. I always used Bisto myself, and anyway Henry, the angel, was plying his intended fifth with Emperor’s Peg---equal parts of vitriol and applejack in his case---at the top of the ruined lighthouse. I incontinently powdered my nose. He told me that, as far as I could gather, a certain good-looking Evelyn Hope was dead. What Hopes? I meant, did one know the family? It was really the way he took it for granted that I would rather hear him talking about Cerebos and Cerebos and Cerebos or something than attend to poor Henry that irritated me beyond endurance.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry (“the angel”); a “new young man” (unnamed) talking about Browning; ruined lighthouse.
  - MAYBE: Henry’s “intended fifth” (unnamed woman); narrator has a “doctor uncle… in the war”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Browning’s “Evelyn Hope” (treated as a “good-looking” person, then “dead”).
  - CERTAIN: O.M./M.O./OM wordplay: “couple of letters” = O.M. (Order of Merit; cf. *The New International Encyclopædia* (1905) on the Order of Merit: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Merit,_Order_of); “my doctor uncle in the war had been just the reverse” = M.O. (Medical Officer); “cut out the stops” (remove periods) gives OM, “vaguely Buddhistic” (cf. “Om mani padme hum” as a Buddhist sacred formula: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Om_Mani_Padme_Hum).
  - LIKELY: Cerebos (salt brand) + Bisto (gravy) used as comic “talking about X and X and X” filler.
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: orthography
- span: "cut out the stops"
- reading: "O.M. -> OM"
- confidence: high
- rationale: “stops” = punctuation dots; removing them from O.M. yields OM, matching the “vaguely Buddhistic” cue in the same sentence.
- falsifier: If another dotted initialism is present and is the intended transform target instead of O.M.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): orthography + reversal
- span: "cut out the stops"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(orthography): O.M. -> OM (Buddhist syllable); plus reversal O.M. ↔ M.O. (Medical Officer)"
- confidence: high
- why it matters: motif -> shows this narrator’s “initialism + punctuation” decoding style, which may recur as an instruction
- falsifiers:
  - “stops” is later used strictly in a musical/organ sense in the same narrator’s pages
  - no other initialism/abbreviation wordplay recurs for this voice
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Drink/poison register: “Emperor’s Peg” is a “peg” (drink of spirits; Webster 1913: https://www.websters1913.com/words/Peg) and Henry’s variant is “equal parts” vitriol (sulphuric acid / “oil of vitriol”, or a metal sulphate; Webster 1913: https://www.websters1913.com/words/Vitriol) + applejack (cider brandy; New International Encyclopædia, 1905, “Cider”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Cider).
  - Lighthouse as rendezvous; cosmetics (“powdered my nose”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Social irritation; fast associative brand-name riffs; possibly feminine-coded gesture (“powdered my nose”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: same Henry as Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md; track Henry’s serial “intended” count.
  - MAYBE: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md (coastal strip: church-side comedy → ruined lighthouse scene). Falsifier: the “new young man”/letters scene is proven to be unrelated to Page 4’s cast/setting.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Henry” becomes clearly distinct by surname/setting later.
  - Identify “Emperor’s Peg” (period recipe/associations).
