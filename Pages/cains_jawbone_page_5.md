I hated my eye for being caught by what didn’t concern me : the powerful grip of the new young man. But it was parading a couple of letters for all to see. Thomas Hardy had been, and my doctor uncle in the war had been just the reverse. And I would have to cut out the stops, I realised futilely, for something vaguely Buddhistic. He went on about Browning. I always used Bisto myself, and anyway Henry, the angel, was plying his intended fifth with Emperor’s Peg---equal parts of vitriol and applejack in his case---at the top of the ruined lighthouse. I incontinently powdered my nose. He told me that, as far as I could gather, a certain good-looking Evelyn Hope was dead. What Hopes? I meant, did one know the family? It was really the way he took it for granted that I would rather hear him talking about Cerebos and Cerebos and Cerebos or something than attend to poor Henry that irritated me beyond endurance.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry (“the angel”); a “new young man” (unnamed) talking about Browning; ruined lighthouse.
  - MAYBE: Henry’s “intended fifth” (unnamed woman); narrator has a “doctor uncle… in the war”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Browning’s “Evelyn Hope” (treated as a “good-looking” person, then “dead”).
  - MAYBE: Thomas Hardy reference (context unclear); “cut out the stops” for something “vaguely Buddhistic” (remove punctuation?).
  - LIKELY: Cerebos (salt brand) + Bisto (gravy) used as comic “talking about X and X and X” filler.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Drink/poison register: “Emperor’s Peg” described as “equal parts of vitriol and applejack” (narrator implies toxic variant).
  - Lighthouse as rendezvous; cosmetics (“powdered my nose”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Social irritation; fast associative brand-name riffs; possibly feminine-coded gesture (“powdered my nose”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: same Henry as Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md; track Henry’s serial “intended” count.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Henry” becomes clearly distinct by surname/setting later.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify “Emperor’s Peg” (period recipe/associations).
  - Interpret “cut out the stops” + “Buddhistic” (which text/phrase?).
  - What are the “couple of letters” being “paraded” (initials? signage?).
