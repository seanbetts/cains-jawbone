In one way, of course, I was glad they were married. I had always been rather a stickler for purity in family life. That scandalous rumour of a Maltese landing on our island and seducing an ancestress of mine---or was it an ancestor?---from the path of duty, I never had and never would believe. If I had had a real education, instead of just listening to him, I could have told---it was bad that day---how I detested being called Hal. It was she that did it. But he was pleased in a way, and said to her, out of a book, the original ground of the transaction appears to have been sentimental : “He was my friend,” says the murderous doctor ; “he was dear to me.” Some Tom, not the one I killed in the matter of Jasmine, had done that, I gathered. He was enthusiastic and provided a chop for me, and said it was good he had visited England to-day for the first time.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator called “Hal” (detests the name; imposed by “she”).
  - MAYBE: “murderous doctor” (quoted speaker in a book).
  - MAYBE: Tom (explicitly “not the one I killed in the matter of Jasmine”).
  - MAYBE: “they” (a married couple; context unclear).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day”; “that day”.
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: England (visited “to-day for the first time” by an unnamed “he”).
  - MAYBE: Malta/Maltese (rumour of a “Maltese landing on our island”).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - “the original ground of the transaction appears to have been sentimental… ‘He was my friend,’ says the murderous doctor; ‘he was dear to me.’”
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Family/purity obsession.
  - Food: “provided a chop for me” (strong animal/dog POV cue).
  - Murder continuity: “the one I killed in the matter of Jasmine” (links to jasmine motif pages).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Naïve/undereducated self-description (“real education… just listening to him”); name/identity sensitivity (“Hal”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: animal POV segment (chop + naming + naïve register).
  - MAYBE: connects to jasmine motif thread and to “murderous doctor”/doctor-leading-old-man pages.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “chop” and “Hal” prove metaphorical and the narrator is clearly human in later linked pages.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the source of the “murderous doctor… friend… dear to me” quotation.
  - Clarify what “the matter of Jasmine” and the two “Tom” references point to.
