He stood and looked down at me ; but I was not to be hurried. The money changed hands slowly ; for I wished to be able to describe him. He seems to have had a great confidence in the opinion of his physicians. I am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice. But there were doctors and doctors, I would have to think seriously of that. And then he went. He went. Simple faith or Norman bluff? But that Douglas was, perhaps, less tender and more true. My heart dilated as soon as the sedulous ape had got out from me. Gone, in a relative sense alas! not positively, finally gone. That was a consummation devoutly to be wished, but yet to be compassed. Whom should I trust with that? I thought of May. May be. May be not. Sunset was already reddish-purple above the Quarry hills, like a bruise on the breast of the evening.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - CERTAIN: “he” (unnamed; money changes hands; guided by physicians/doctors).
  - CERTAIN: May (named; invoked as a decision pivot: “May be. May be not.”).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: sunset (“Sunset was already reddish-purple…”).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - MAYBE: narrator wishes him “positively, finally gone” and considers whom to trust to achieve that (possible murder-hiring intent).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Money exchange + desire to later “describe him” (witness/identification register).
  - Medical framing (“physicians”; “proper medical advice”; “doctors and doctors”).
  - May-wordplay (person vs month; “May be” pun).
- **Places:**
  - MAYBE: Quarry hills (unidentified; could be a setting anchor if matched elsewhere).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “a consummation devoutly to be wished” (Shakespeare, *Hamlet*).
  - CERTAIN: “played the sedulous ape” (imitative style-learning) is Robert Louis Stevenson, “The Question of Style” (*The Craftsmanship of Writing*): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Craftsmanship_of_Writing/The_Question_of_Style.
  - CERTAIN: “Douglas… tender and more true” alludes to Walter Scott, *Marmion*, Canto Fifth (“More tender and more true: Forgive me, Douglas, once again”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Marmion/Canto_Fifth. (CJ’s “less tender and more true” appears to be a deliberate inversion of “More tender and more true”.)
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “gone… finally gone” is purely metaphorical (departure rather than death intent).
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify “Quarry hills” (and whether it anchors a specific locality).
