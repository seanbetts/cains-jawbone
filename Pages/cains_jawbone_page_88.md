I always liked to listen to him. It was St. Wigbert’s day, I was told, and Augustus, I remembered, was a chubby lad. I was getting quite clever in that way. He said his stepson had been misunderstood for a long time, and had gone out to-day. He said his third son had been crude. I did not entirely understand ; but I had a lot of good Tate. She said to him. He said to her. The consequence was rather dreadful, but out of doors. I had got a little sick, too, of the way they went on ; like that Tom and Flora’s Jasmine. Perhaps that was really it. They were having their first quarrel, about the new distemper. She was all for Dark French Grey and he for Egg Shell Green. Yet I knew they’d get over that. I had. But each, too, began to say things about how few the other had done so late in the year. I don’t know why, but I felt that mice were dancing on my little slab.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - CERTAIN: “he” (unnamed speaker; mentions stepson/sons).
  - CERTAIN: “she” (unnamed interlocutor in the “He said… She said…” pattern).
  - MAYBE: stepson / third son (offstage family references).
  - LIKELY: `P100` Tom (the “he”) and `P101` Flora (the “she”) are the quarrelling couple being observed/listened to (named explicitly in “Tom and Flora’s Jasmine”; compare unnamed couple on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md); LIKELY a different Flora than the dog‑mate on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md / Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md.
  - MAYBE: Jasmine (LIKELY the cat from Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md; possessive phrasing suggests a household pet).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: St. Wigbert’s day = Aug 13 (*Catholic Encyclopedia*, “St. Wigbert”: recorded in the *Martyrologium Romanum* under 13 August).
  - CERTAIN: “to-day”.
  - CERTAIN: “so late in the year”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: Augustus (allusive; could be month/emperor/saint-day adjacency).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - CERTAIN: “Tate” = sugar brand (Henry Tate made “Tate’s Cube Sugar” famous; *Encyclopaedia Britannica* 1911, “TATE, SIR HENRY”, Page:EB1911_-_Volume_26.djvu/478).
  - CERTAIN: distemper = water-based paint (“for distemper water is employed”; *Encyclopaedia Britannica* 1911, “PAINTER-WORK”, Page:EB1911_-_Volume_20.djvu/496).
  - Distemper colour debate (Dark French Grey vs Egg Shell Green) suggests decorating quarrel (or a coded colour clue).
  - Mice imagery (“mice were dancing on my little slab”) echoes other pages’ mouse-pressure imagery (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md).
  - Jasmine reference (“Tom and Flora’s Jasmine”) LIKELY refers to the named cat on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md (bridge to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md / Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md), but do not use the shared name “Flora” as an ordering bridge unless another non-name anchor appears.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Social-observer stance: repetitive “He said… She said…” with narrator not fully understanding.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md (shared Tate sugar + similar “he said… she said…” domestic register; see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N02` Sequence C).
  - MAYBE: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md as a later “listening to him” domestic beat (same phrasing; see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N02` Sequence C).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If St. Wigbert’s day is shown to be an in-world nickname rather than a calendar marker.
  - If “Tom and Flora’s Jasmine” is shown to be a different Jasmine (person/plant/paint) unrelated to the Page 22 cat.
