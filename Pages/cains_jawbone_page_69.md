I came out of my waking dream with temples moist and tongue most damnably dry. I had to believe myself, for I had never previously deceived myself. Yes, I cam to myself, if you must know, when yon same star, that’s westward from the pole, had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns. A time, I thought, not only utterly depressing in itself, but also, when one is alone, as Dutch as dillwater. What, I asked myself, ought I to do? The answer was plain enough. When I was ten I had messily collected eggs. When I was twelve I had collected bus tickets and, if I had known where to look for them, would doubtless have collected whole ickets also. The answer was plain enough. I must---oh, final and most difficult hobby!---collect myself. It was ghastly. I had seen every minute of it. I had seen a poor old man done slowly to death before my eyes.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “poor old man” (unnamed; “done slowly to death” before narrator’s eyes).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “yon same star… westward from the pole…” (Hamlet time-setting line; indicates late night).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “yon same star, that’s westward from the pole…” (Shakespeare, *Hamlet* Act 1 Scene 1).
  - MAYBE: “as Dutch as dillwater” (idiom; check if it encodes something).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Collecting motif escalated to self-control (“collect myself”).
  - Physical aftermath: moist temples + dry tongue (stress, drink, illness?).
  - Explicit slow death witnessed (possible poisoning/neglect; unclear).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-assertion (“never previously deceived myself”) + punning wordplay (“ickets”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md (post–crucial-meeting trigger) as the late-night aftermath of the old-man slow-death scene.
  - MAYBE: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md / Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md as motivation for producing a full “hour by hour, day by day” written account (time-granularity echo: “seen every minute of it”).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “done slowly to death” is later shown to be figurative (bored/exhausted) rather than literal.
- **Research needed:**
  - Confirm the Hamlet line’s time implication (and whether it constrains ordering relative to other night/morning markers).
