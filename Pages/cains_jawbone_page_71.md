But next day that religious fellow’s head drapery, if I might thus unscientifically express myself, showed signs, it seemed to me, after that initial success, of failing. I would give it till midnight. Do not misunderstand me. Why should I not play the Spartan mother with emotion, be the Lucius Junius Brutus of my kind? I thought of May. Over them came old odour of red May. Lovely, indeed, but not appropriate. I felt that I was letting May down. As for the other, I had, of course, no intention of letting up. Henry, before our tea of anchovy toast and various hot dishes (I was never a stinter) riotously displayed himself all over me. He hit me once full in the eye, and I remembered, I could not help remembering, Elsie’s difficulty when the young coastguard had tried to prove to her his direct descent from Herebald the Drake. “I will,” she quoted, “express my duty in his eye.”

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry (behaves physically; “displayed himself all over me”; hit narrator in the eye).
  - MAYBE: May (person or “May” as a flower/month motif; narrator fears “letting May down”).
  - CERTAIN: Elsie (recalled; “difficulty” with a young coastguard).
  - CERTAIN: young coastguard (unnamed; claimed descent from Herebald the Drake).
  - MAYBE: Herebald is a historical name (disciple of St John of Beverley; later abbot of Tynemouth), making the coastguard’s “direct descent” claim sound like bluff/malapropism (DNB): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/John_of_Beverley_(d.721)
  - MAYBE: “religious fellow” (unnamed; has “head drapery” that is failing).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “next day”.
  - CERTAIN: deadline “till midnight”.
  - CERTAIN: “before our tea” (meal-time anchor).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “express my duty in his eye” — Shakespeare, *Hamlet* (Act IV: “We shall express our duty in his eye…”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1917)_Yale/Text/Act_IV
  - MAYBE: Spartan mother / Lucius Junius Brutus (stoic virtue allusions; tone-setting).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Flowers/seasonal scent: “old odour of red May” (links to later “blight on the May” language).
  - Food: anchovy toast + “various hot dishes”.
  - Eyes/vision: struck “full in the eye”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Determined, moralising self-casting (“no intention of letting up”); classical-name register.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: clusters with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md (May/blight + plant language) and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md (eyes failing) via eyesight/flower motifs.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “May” is clearly only the calendar month and has no continuity with later “May” references.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify “Herebald the Drake” and whether it’s genealogical wordplay or a specific reference.
