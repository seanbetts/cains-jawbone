The girl had left Henry by this time, thank God. She was an obvious whey-face. She didn’t seem capable for a moment of understanding those first two killings of his. He was being a dear. He had sent the rector’s aunt away, as he explained to the girl, like a bee with a sore bonnet. A foreign touch. Killing time, yes. I was doing that. It was funny how idly the mind worked ; or seeming idly. Perhaps there was something in heredity after all. I pondered to its direction. An accent was a terrible thing, I thought. Killing timewouldn’t be so good. I realised that I was impressionable, that I liked a good murder. But Hodge, once settled, wasn’t in the least like a singer. He had a wen, and scratched his left whisker. I supposed it would be different to suddenly develop a wen for someone. Different and messier. He asked me about Ben Wade, hitherto merely mutely unemployed, and of course I said the right thing.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - MAYBE: “the girl” (Henry’s companion; “whey-face”; unnamed).
  - MAYBE: rector’s aunt (unnamed).
  - MAYBE: Hodge (asks narrator about “Ben Wade”).
  - LIKELY: Ben Wade (pipe brand; see *Life*, 1912: “What could be sweeter than a Ben Wade pipe?” https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oE6vVC1I8TYC&pg=PA1&vq=%22Ben+Wade%22).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Murder fascination: narrator “liked a good murder”.
  - Accent/heredity: “An accent was a terrible thing”; “something in heredity”.
  - Physical tell: Hodge has a “wen” and scratches “left whisker”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Darkly amused, judgemental (“whey-face”); punning on “killing time”.
  - “bee with a sore bonnet” reads like a “foreign touch”/malapropism of the idiom “bear with a sore head” (Kipling, *The Light That Failed*, Ch. 12: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Light_That_Failed/Chapter_12).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md (first two killings → third/fourth victims + “official knock”).
  - MAYBE: another Henry-occurrence that intensifies “killings/victim” framing (compare Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md; falsifier: Henry-role/setting incompatibility).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later context shows “killings” is figurative (e.g., stage/role talk) rather than literal murder.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) “Ben Wade” likely refers to a Ben Wade pipe (brand) (e.g., *Life*, 1912: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oE6vVC1I8TYC&pg=PA1&vq=%22Ben+Wade%22).
  - (Resolved) “bee with a sore bonnet” likely riffs on “bear with a sore head” (Kipling, *The Light That Failed*, Ch. 12: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Light_That_Failed/Chapter_12).
