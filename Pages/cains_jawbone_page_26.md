The girl had left Henry by this time, thank God. She was an obvious whey-face. She didn’t seem capable for a moment of understanding those first two killings of his. He was being a dear. He had sent the rector’s aunt away, as he explained to the girl, like a bee with a sore bonnet. A foreign touch. Killing time, yes. I was doing that. It was funny how idly the mind worked ; or seeming idly. Perhaps there was something in heredity after all. I pondered to its direction. An accent was a terrible thing, I thought. Killing timewouldn’t be so good. I realised that I was impressionable, that I liked a good murder. But Hodge, once settled, wasn’t in the least like a singer. He had a wen, and scratched his left whisker. I supposed it would be different to suddenly develop a wen for someone. Different and messier. He asked me about Ben Wade, hitherto merely mutely unemployed, and of course I said the right thing.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - MAYBE: “the girl” (Henry’s companion; “whey-face”; unnamed).
  - MAYBE: rector’s aunt (unnamed).
  - MAYBE: Hodge (asks narrator about “Ben Wade”).
  - MAYBE: Ben Wade (reference/person/character).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Murder fascination: narrator “liked a good murder”.
  - Accent/heredity: “An accent was a terrible thing”; “something in heredity”.
  - Physical tell: Hodge has a “wen” and scratches “left whisker”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Darkly amused, judgemental (“whey-face”); punning on “killing time”.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: another Henry-occurrence that intensifies “killings/victim” framing (compare Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later context shows “killings” is figurative (e.g., stage/role talk) rather than literal murder.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify “Ben Wade” and whether it’s meant to be a real person/character/date anchor.
  - Identify the phrase “like a bee with a sore bonnet” (“foreign touch”) if it recurs.
