Could I be developing a green-eyed streak? I investigated the body before me with the aid of a powerful glass. At least I always thought of it as powerful, because I never could quite understand how it worked. I knew I ought to have the body as long as possible. At last I was satisfied. I measured the distance carefully with my eye : a good forty inches, I made it. I gathered from his talk that Guido looked his last to-day on the sausage place---furtively I knew how excellent---and that Kilmarnock and Belmerino completely lost their heads. But whether or not this was cause and effect I couldn’t make out. I wished for the hundredth time I had a better brain. Later she was wearing the same bow---I loathed bows myself---and that time he found them and trimmed the left end. Then he turned what he was holding a bit ; so that it pushed its way right through. Then he twiddled the black knobby thing, and Mr. Hall burst in upon us. The knobby thing was black and red.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: Mr. Hall (bursts in at the end of the scene).
  - MAYBE: Guido / Kilmarnock / Belmerino (calendar-history references rather than in-scene people).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day” (paired with Guido + Kilmarnock + Belmerino; likely a date anchor).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “green-eyed” jealousy phrase (source TBD).
  - LIKELY: “Guido” = Guido Reni; “sausage place” = Bologna (pun) (needs confirmation).
  - LIKELY: Kilmarnock + Balmerino beheaded on the same date (needs confirmation).
- **Wordplay:**
  - LIKELY: “sausage place” as Bologna/Baloney pun.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Measuring/optics: “powerful glass”; careful measuring; “forty inches”.
  - Bows; trimming/piercing; “black knobby thing… black and red” (mechanical detail).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Naïve about optics (“never could quite understand how it worked”); self-deprecating (“better brain”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: date adjacency with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md if “Hyacinth’s day” is Aug 17 and this “to-day” is Aug 18.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Guido/Kilmarnock/Belmerino are later tied to a different date or not intended as calendar anchors.
- **Research needed:**
  - Confirm the intended “Guido” identification + the date (and what “sausage place” points to).
  - Confirm the Kilmarnock/Balmerino reference and its date.
  - Identify the “black knobby thing” + the action sequence (trim/turn/push through) and who “Mr. Hall” is.
