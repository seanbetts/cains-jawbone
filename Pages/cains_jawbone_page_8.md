Could I be developing a green-eyed streak? I investigated the body before me with the aid of a powerful glass. At least I always thought of it as powerful, because I never could quite understand how it worked. I knew I ought to have the body as long as possible. At last I was satisfied. I measured the distance carefully with my eye : a good forty inches, I made it. I gathered from his talk that Guido looked his last to-day on the sausage place---furtively I knew how excellent---and that Kilmarnock and Belmerino completely lost their heads. But whether or not this was cause and effect I couldn’t make out. I wished for the hundredth time I had a better brain. Later she was wearing the same bow---I loathed bows myself---and that time he found them and trimmed the left end. Then he turned what he was holding a bit ; so that it pushed its way right through. Then he twiddled the black knobby thing, and Mr. Hall burst in upon us. The knobby thing was black and red.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - LIKELY: Mr. Hall (a servant/household subordinate who enters when the call-bell is rung).
  - MAYBE: Guido / Kilmarnock / Belmerino (calendar-history references rather than in-scene people).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day” (Guido Reni died in Bologna on 18 Aug 1642; Kilmarnock + Balmerino were beheaded on 18 Aug 1746 → “to-day” ≈ Aug 18).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “green-eyed streak” alludes to jealousy as the “green-ey’d monster” (Iago, Shakespeare’s *Othello*; see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
  - CERTAIN: “Guido” = Guido Reni; “sausage place” = Bologna (pun).
  - CERTAIN: Kilmarnock + Balmerino were beheaded on the same date as Guido Reni’s death (18 Aug).
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: double definition
- span: "sausage place"
- reading: "sausage place -> Bologna (city; also sausage)"
- confidence: high
- rationale: Bologna is both a city and a sausage; the phrase is paired with Guido Reni’s death-in-Bologna anchor.
- falsifier: “sausage place” is later shown to refer to a different location (not Bologna).

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): double definition
- span: "sausage place"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): sausage place -> Bologna (city; also sausage)"
- confidence: high
- why it matters: place -> supports Bologna as a concrete setting cue inside this page’s calendar-style “to-day” anchors
- falsifiers:
  - later evidence shows “sausage place” is a private nickname, not the city pun
  - Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino are shown to be non-calendar allusions in this context
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Measuring/optics: “powerful glass”; careful measuring; “forty inches”.
  - Bows; trimming/piercing; “he found them and trimmed the left end” likely refers to the missing scissors/implements (“jossers” on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md) used to fix the unequal bow ends; “black knobby thing… black and red” (mechanical detail).
  - Bells/summoning: “black knobby thing” is LIKELY a call-bell/bell-push used to summon Mr. Hall (cf. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md bell opening).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Naïve about optics (“never could quite understand how it worked”); self-deprecating (“better brain”).
  - LIKELY dog-coded appetite tell: “sausage place… furtively I knew how excellent” reads more naturally as a non-human POV (secret food knowledge) than as human travel-talk.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md (“jossers” + the unequal love‑knot/bow appear only there; this page’s “Later… the same bow… trimmed the left end” reads as the immediate follow-on).
  - CERTAIN: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md (both use the knob + Mr. Hall summons; p19 says he “came into the room again” and “Mr. Hall” appears only on these two pages).
  - MAYBE: part of a mid‑August daybook run (Aug 18 anchor); could sit near Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md (Hyacinth’s day Aug 16) and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md (Potsdam “closing day” Aug 17) if date anchors are consecutive for this narrator.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later evidence makes “powerful glass” an unequivocally hand-held optical tool operated by the narrator (human-only physical action), treat this page as a shared domestic-scene overlap rather than core `N02`.
  - If Guido/Kilmarnock/Belmerino are later tied to a different date or not intended as calendar anchors.
- **Research needed:**
  - Resolved: Guido/Bologna + Kilmarnock/Balmerino both point to Aug 18 (see Indexes/research_queue.md).
  - Resolved: “black knobby thing” is a call-bell/bell-push; Mr. Hall is the summoned servant (see Indexes/research_queue.md).
  - Resolved: “green-eyed streak” jealousy phrase (see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
