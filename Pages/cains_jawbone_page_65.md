I started to read Hardy’s exquisite production, and every muscle of my brain was enthralled until I came to the end. Just such another must have been the Monk Arnulphus when he uncorked his ink. His palette gleamed with a burnished green as bright as a dragon-fly’s skin : his gold-leaf shone like the robe of a queen. There could be no slightest doubt. I would now be able to reap the harvest. And Ruth would have little gleaning. I thought of her mother and laughed aloud. All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That’s his. I could not help echoing Jack’s question : is that clever? The Monk Arnulphus, with a dash of Jim the Penman. How, I wondered, did I strike him? I knew I should like to. His was obviously a slow methodical brain, used to pigeon-holing by type. In that case, I thought I knew the type : learned in a macabre way, even distinguished.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Ruth (rival/other party; “would have little gleaning”).
  - CERTAIN: Jack (Wilde character referenced by name).
  - MAYBE: “him” (slow, methodical classifier; “pigeon-holing by type”).
  - MAYBE: Monk Arnulphus (scribe/artist reference; needs ID).
  - MAYBE: “Jim the Penman” (reference; needs ID).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “All women become like their mothers… No man does. That’s his.” (Oscar Wilde, *The Importance of Being Earnest*).
  - CERTAIN: “is that clever?” (Jack’s line in *The Importance of Being Earnest* context).
  - LIKELY: “reap the harvest… Ruth… gleaning” (Book of Ruth wordplay).
  - MAYBE: “Hardy’s exquisite production” (Thomas Hardy work; identify which).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Reading/interpretation as competition (harvest vs gleaning).
  - Manuscript/illumination imagery (green palette; gold leaf) + “uncorked his ink”.
  - Classification/typing (“pigeon-holing by type”) as a profession tell.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Triumphal, witty, and slightly cruel; frames people as “types”.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to wills/forgery/paperwork clusters via writing/typing + classification themes.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Wilde quotations are purely decorative and do not signal narrator identity/cluster.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify which Hardy work is meant.
  - Identify Monk Arnulphus and “Jim the Penman”.
  - Clarify what “pigeon-holing by type” refers to (typewriter fonts? librarian systems? police records?).
