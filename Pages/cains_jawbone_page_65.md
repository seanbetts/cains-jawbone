I started to read Hardy’s exquisite production, and every muscle of my brain was enthralled until I came to the end. Just such another must have been the Monk Arnulphus when he uncorked his ink. His palette gleamed with a burnished green as bright as a dragon-fly’s skin : his gold-leaf shone like the robe of a queen. There could be no slightest doubt. I would now be able to reap the harvest. And Ruth would have little gleaning. I thought of her mother and laughed aloud. All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That’s his. I could not help echoing Jack’s question : is that clever? The Monk Arnulphus, with a dash of Jim the Penman. How, I wondered, did I strike him? I knew I should like to. His was obviously a slow methodical brain, used to pigeon-holing by type. In that case, I thought I knew the type : learned in a macabre way, even distinguished.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Ruth (rival/other party; “would have little gleaning”).
  - CERTAIN: Jack (Wilde character referenced by name).
  - MAYBE: “him” (slow, methodical classifier; “pigeon-holing by type”).
  - CERTAIN: Monk Arnulphus (poem allusion; Miles (ed.), *The Poets and the Poetry of the Century: Charles Kingsley to James Thomson* (1898), p. 391).
  - CERTAIN: “Jim the Penman” (Sir Charles Lawrence Young play title; *Jim the Penman* (1880)).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “All women become like their mothers… No man does. That’s his.” (Oscar Wilde, *The Importance of Being Earnest*).
  - CERTAIN: “is that clever?” (Jack’s line in *The Importance of Being Earnest* context).
  - LIKELY: “reap the harvest… Ruth… gleaning” (Book of Ruth wordplay).
  - CERTAIN: “Monk Arnulphus uncorked his ink… dragon-fly’s skin… gold-leaf… robe of a queen.” (Miles (ed.), *The Poets and the Poetry of the Century: Charles Kingsley to James Thomson* (1898), p. 391).
  - CERTAIN: “Jim the Penman.” (Sir Charles Lawrence Young, *Jim the Penman* (1880)).
  - LIKELY: “Hardy’s exquisite production” = Thomas Hardy, “The Distracted Preacher” (reviewed as “The Distracted Young Preacher” in *Vanity Fair* (May 3, 1879) and called “Hardy’s exquisite sketch… a delight from end to end.”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=725HAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA246 and https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=725HAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA254
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Reading/interpretation as competition (harvest vs gleaning).
  - Manuscript/illumination imagery (green palette; gold leaf) + “uncorked his ink”.
  - Classification/typing (“pigeon-holing by type”) as a profession tell (LIKELY literal filing/sorting; Chambers 1908 “pigeon-hole” = “division of a case for papers”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Philopena_Pistachio; “type” includes printing type/typewriter: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Tup_Tzigany).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Triumphal, witty, and slightly cruel; frames people as “types”.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to wills/forgery/paperwork clusters via writing/typing + classification themes.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Wilde quotations are purely decorative and do not signal narrator identity/cluster.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify who “him” is (if this scene is continued elsewhere); “pigeon-holing by type” now reads as clerical/printer filing language rather than a unique named system.
