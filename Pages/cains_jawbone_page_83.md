A flower-seller, fed ruddily, it seemed, on hope, broke in and would have made a round of all of us. But she hurried away perforce without gaining her point, leaving me with an inexpensive memory of countryside flowers. Our own and other countries : ironic daffodils, irises of the stream, young pert bluebells, the foreign hedge-rose and carnation. No gaudy melon flower, indeed. Oh, to be in England ; how unquotable he had become. For I was, was I not? I must learn Spanish one of these days, only for that slow sweet name’s sake. I paused to pass my tongue over the dew distilled by the red rose, the sole survivor, and made a sign which brought Henry cat-like to me over the floor. Here the old man dropped some metallic object and his companion retrieved it with daughterly swiftness. The hoarse newsboys with their shouting of the late night final, as of accomplished mal de mer, disturbed me a little. Would there be any news? She enquired faintly what he meant by that stuff about good news from Ghent.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: flower-seller (unnamed; makes a round of the group).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (summoned “cat-like… over the floor”).
  - CERTAIN: “old man” (drops a metallic object).
  - CERTAIN: old man’s companion (retrieves the object “with daughterly swiftness”).
  - MAYBE: “she” (enquires faintly about “good news from Ghent”).
  - CERTAIN: newsboys (shouting “late night final”).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: late night (“late night final”).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Oh, to be in England” (Browning allusion; “unquotable he had become”).
  - CERTAIN: “I must learn Spanish… only for that slow sweet name’s sake” = Browning, “The Flower’s Name” (Bells and Pomegranates, Second Series): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bells_and_Pomegranates,_Second_Series/The_Flower%27s_Name.
  - CERTAIN: “good news from Ghent” (Browning, *How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix*).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Flowers: countryside-flower catalogue; red rose “sole survivor”.
  - Sensory gesture: tasting dew from the rose.
  - MAYBE: metallic object drop/retrieval is a continuity prop (LIKELY a coin/half-crown, echoing Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md’s “half-crowns dropped upon marble” phrasing).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Lyrical flower-cataloguing + abrupt attention shifts (newsboys, “news?” anxiety).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: later extension of the `N06` flower/documents run, following Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md (flower-state progression: “red rose and the white only remained” → “two other flowers” → “red rose, the sole survivor”; plus shared “old man” + “she asked what he meant” conversational shape; see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N06` Sequence B). Not necessarily adjacent.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the red-rose phrasing is generic and no other shared props/voices recur.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify what the metallic object is and whether it recurs.
