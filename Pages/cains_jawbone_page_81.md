The victim, for that I must now reluctantly call him, blocked all the sweet air from the window. He put out his hand and asked if death were so unlike sleep caught this way. Sed he. Death’s to fear from flame or steel, I sickeningly gathered, or poison doubtless ; but from water---feel. Go find the bottom! He was asking for it. Was he to be disappointed? Oh, yeah. A babbled o’ green fields (sorry, even in retrospect the habit is catching) which he could not have seen at all well. I pulled up his socks for him, and heaved outward with all my strength. The window was no more dark. The fool, with any luck, was dead. What had he said as he finally left me? It sounded like Quails and Arty and Fakes. Fakes, Quails and Arty. Band, Speckled. No, I could make nothing of that. But, thank goodness, I was no detective.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: unnamed victim (“The victim… blocked… the window”).
  - CERTAIN: narrator (physically throws victim outward).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - CERTAIN: victim is heaved out of a window (“heaved outward with all my strength”).
  - LIKELY: drowning/death is intended (“Go find the bottom!”; “with any luck, was dead”).
- **Means/method:**
  - LIKELY: drowning after being thrown from a window above water.
  - MAYBE: staging/neatening (“pulled up his socks for him” before the push).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “a babbled o’ green fields” (Shakespeare, *Henry V*; Falstaff death reported by Mistress Quickly).
  - MAYBE: “Band, Speckled” (Conan Doyle, *The Adventure of the Speckled Band*).
  - CERTAIN: “Death’s to fear from flame or steel… but from water—feel” — Robert Browning, “In a Gondola” (*Bells and Pomegranates*, First Series): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bells_and_Pomegranates,_First_Series/In_a_Gondola
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Misheard last words (“Quails… Arty… Fakes… Band, Speckled”) as a possible cipher/anagram/homophone clue.
  - Window/air/light imagery (“window was no more dark”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Black humour + self-exculpation (“thank goodness, I was no detective”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: pairs with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md (same murder-rationalising narrator register; multiple killings).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the victim survives (later pages) or the scene is revealed as metaphorical/storytelling.
- **Research needed:**
  - Decode/identify “Quails and Arty and Fakes… Band, Speckled.”
