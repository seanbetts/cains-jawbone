The best I had done seemed to me blank and suspicious, my great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? Next day I would have to pay for all I had had of solace, and for all I would have later. It would, I thought, have seemed impossible to link Will’s friend Ben with Will’s wife, and yet they went off together, or at least on that same day : the bricklayer out of Annandale and the inheritor of the second-best bed : strange bedfellows. Underneath this stone, he had said, doth lie as much Beauty as could die ; but of course he hadn’t been talking about her. Nor had either had anything to do with my waking, my strong tea, and my first pill. That all happened by the Mole, and there was the oldest brass in England, saying : SIRE : IOHAN : DAUBERNOUN : CHIVALER : GIST : ICY : DEV : DE : SA : ALME : EYT : MERCY. Good enough. We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again, we two.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: Will (likely Shakespeare); Ben (likely Ben Jonson); Will’s wife (likely Anne Hathaway via “second-best bed”).
  - MAYBE: “bricklayer out of Annandale” (Ben Jonson clue) and “inheritor of the second-best bed” (Anne Hathaway clue).
  - CERTAIN: Sir Iohan Daubernoun (named on brass inscription).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “Next day…”
  - MAYBE: “my waking… my strong tea, and my first pill” (morning routine).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “Underneath this stone… as much Beauty as could die” (epitaph snippet; source TBD).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Pills + strong tea (possible continuity with other pill/drug pages).
  - Antiquarian anchor: “oldest brass in England” inscription (French/Latinized spelling).
  - Circling/returning (“circled and circled… arrived home again, we two”).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: “by the Mole” (River Mole implied).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Antiquarian/inscription interest; literary-name riddling (Will/Ben/bed).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: pill thread with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md (pills) and other “first pill” narrators.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Mole” later resolves to something non-geographic (pet/name) rather than the river.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the epitaph line (“Underneath this stone… Beauty…”) and who “he” is.
  - Confirm the “oldest brass in England” location (Sir John Daubernoun) and whether it anchors a specific place sequence.
