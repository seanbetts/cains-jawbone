The picture of the Old Mill at Bramley, with its medlar tree overhanging the water, its octagonal brick dovecot, and its sweet water grape vine, had not detained me the day before. I had groped for my first cigarette of the day, eyes hardly open, a few miles on. So easily were things forgotten! I found it difficult to realise that to-day had once been an English holiday, like that other fifth, and for much the same reason. James had got off, the Earl and his brother Alexander had emphatically not. But the whole thing was not clear to me, and I doubted if it was to anyone. The two smells, of the medlar and the vine, had been the two notes of a chord, venetian red and peridot, that bit one ear gently and the other hard---or did I mean loud and tenuous?---a monotone save for this variation : once it had been hard, gentle, hard, hard, gentle, gentle, gentle hard. It had been a pretty smell.

## Notes

- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Bramley (Old Mill picture; exact Bramley uncertain).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “the day before”; “to-day”.
  - MAYBE: “English holiday… like that other fifth… James… the Earl and his brother Alexander” (likely a specific historical “deliverance” date; could be a calendar anchor).
- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: James (likely King James VI/I reference).
  - MAYBE: “the Earl and his brother Alexander” (likely Gowrie conspiracy reference; needs confirmation).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Smell/synaesthesia: medlar + vine as chord; colours (venetian red, peridot).
  - Encoded pattern? “hard, gentle…” sequence may be deliberate (binary/musical/ear-coded).
  - Cigarette routine: “first cigarette of the day”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Sensory (smell → colour/sound) and self-correcting (“or did I mean…”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to other smell-centric narrator pages (e.g., Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md).
  - MAYBE: a date-anchor page if the “fifth” holiday is identified.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “holiday” reference is merely associative and the hard/gentle pattern never reappears or yields structure.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the referenced “English holiday” and confirm whether it’s the Gowrie/James deliverance day (and what date “to-day” implies).
  - Identify the specific “Old Mill at Bramley” (Surrey vs Hampshire; details).
  - Determine whether the hard/gentle sequence encodes something (music/Morse/etc.) and whether it recurs.
