The ancient had then sat down among the heather to a great dish of brown and swimming collops. Personally, as far as my stomach went, I could not love the deer so much, loved I not on a moor, with concomitant Spey Royal to drown the taste. Nor was that likely to happen in this case. The absence of old friends one can endure with equanimity. But even a momentary separation from anyone to whom one has just been introduced is almost unbearable. Circumstances, I thought, as I looked over at the man, alter cases. I would give the rogue a chance. “Have you a good memory?” I asked. “Intermittent but long,” he answered. That signed his death warrant. Well, signatures were his business. The gold was being cleared out of the light ; the remaining silver was, how shall I say?, unsatisfactory. I also had flaunted the panache---it lay at that moment beneath my lips---to the public without ever having been satisfied with it.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “ancient” / “the man” (unnamed; eats collops; answers about memory).
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - MAYBE: narrator intends to kill the man (“That signed his death warrant”) because his memory is “long”.
- **Means/method:**
  - MAYBE: alcohol/whisky context is foregrounded (Spey Royal), but no killing method is stated.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Food/drink: deer/collops; Spey Royal.
  - Legal/detective register: “Circumstances alter cases”; “death warrant”.
  - Signatures/document thread: “signatures were his business” (forgery/will cluster adjacency).
  - “Panache” beneath the lips (object/appearance prop; unclear).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Threatening punning (signature → death warrant) + self-conscious style commentary.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: continues into Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md (old gentleman arrives; deer-stalker + fancy parquet setting).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “death warrant” is purely idiomatic (no in-world death intended).
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify what “panache… beneath my lips” refers to (object/appearance).
  - Determine whether the “signatures” business links to the will/forgery cluster.
