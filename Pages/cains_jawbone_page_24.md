        Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.


Next day I saw that my suspicions of Caroline had been well-founded. This was an infernal nuisance ; a Chinese confrère of mine might even have called it a hellebore. It was annoying to share the house with someone who reacted to wild jasmine much as he reacted to roses. He throve on my roses. To that extent I was satisfied with him. Puffing at Gianaclis and blowing at myself for a fool, I tried to consider my competence, or lack of it. I had always thought that to carry the name of fourteen popes and two anti-popes meant nothing to me either way. To share it with Giulio de Medici might sound more sinister to the uninstructed. At least the quality of mercy was little exerted, much less strained, in me. Roses automatically reminded me of my aunt Cynthia who had, before there was any constraint between them, asked the poor old Ahkoond of Swat to share a dream next with her heart among these decorative but vestigial flowers.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Caroline (suspicions “well-founded”).
  - MAYBE: “he” (shares the house; reacts to jasmine/roses; “throve on my roses”).
  - CERTAIN: Gianaclis (cigarettes brand).
  - CERTAIN: Giulio de Medici (Pope Clement VII) (reference).
  - CERTAIN: Aunt Cynthia.
  - CERTAIN: Ahkoond (Akhund) of Swat = Abdul Ghafur (1794–1877), religious leader who dominated Swat; “Ahkoond” is a variant spelling. (EB1911 “Swat”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Swat)
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “Next day…”
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Yeats continuation line: “Of Cathleen the daughter of Houlihan” — “The Song of Red Hanrahan” (*In the Seven Woods*, 1903), Page:In_the_Seven_Woods,_Yeats,_1903.djvu/32; compare the CJ substitution on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md (“Of the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.”).
  - CERTAIN: “the quality of mercy” (Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice).
  - CERTAIN: name clue: “fourteen popes and two anti-popes” → “Clement” (EB1911 “Clement” opens “the name of fourteen popes and two anti-popes”). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Clement
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Flowers/plants: wild jasmine, roses, hellebore.
  - Smoking; self-reproach.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Gardener/plant-person voice; moral hardness (“quality of mercy… little exerted”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: connects to “Clement” thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md) via the pope-name clue.
  - MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md (Page 24 opens “Next day…”, and both pages share a domestic suspicion beat + jasmine register; Sequence B in `Order/hypotheses.md`’s `N03` block).
  - MAYBE: overlap with `N13` (Caroline Jasmine + Yeats substitution key): “Caroline” here could be Caroline Jasmine (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md), and the Yeats line at the top of this page is the source-text counterpart of the substituted line on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md.
  - MAYBE: jasmine motif link to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md (cat Jasmine) and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md (Jasmine’s day).
  - MAYBE: poison/plant cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later text explicitly gives a different narrator name (not Clement) or shows the pope-count is a red herring.
  - If “Caroline” is explicitly a different person from Caroline Jasmine (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md), weakening the `N13` overlap read.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) EB1911 “Clement” matches the “fourteen popes and two anti-popes” formulation.
  - (Resolved) Ahkoond of Swat = Abdul Ghafur (1794–1877) per EB1911 “Swat”.
