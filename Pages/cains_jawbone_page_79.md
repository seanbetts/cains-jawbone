It was that day my friend Sandy told me he was sure he wouldn’t sleep all night. There was, of course, a difference between us. I couldn’t get all worked up like that. You see, next day he would be allowed to fetch back Lagopus Scoticus, whom I knew well, and he hadn’t been allowed to do that for such a long time. I was fond of Sandy and rejoiced with him. But I felt, I couldn’t help feeling, that there was something wrong, something disjoined about my very front. I made love to Flora again in the back parts ; the result was satisfactory enough. I was feeling quite at my best, but I took Bob Martin in completely. After all he liked me to, and he was always right. But I had come to the conclusion that I loathed her ; she kept colouring up. I understood why he had once said to me about something being as flush as May. Also she wore her hair in a cluster of little sly curls, a thing which in our family emphatically was not done.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Sandy (friend; likely another dog/animal in this POV).
  - CERTAIN: Lagopus scoticus (red grouse; object of retrieval/hunting).
  - CERTAIN: Flora (recipient of narrator’s mating; likely dog/animal).
  - CERTAIN: Bob Martin (dog medicine product; “tasteless condition powders”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mxHOAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA6-PA5&dq=Bob+Martin.
  - LIKELY: Flora is the “she/her”; “colouring up” may be a bitch‑in‑season cue (supports the dog‑mate reading).
  - MAYBE: “he” (unnamed; administers Bob Martin; “always right”).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “that day” / “next day” (anticipation of being allowed to retrieve again).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Strong animal POV signals: mating described anatomically; hunting/retrieval; medicine ingestion.
  - May simile: “as flush as May” (could be month/flower or person-name echo).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Non-human register (body-part framing; obedience to administered medicine; hunting anticipation).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md (p22 introduces Flora + first “made love”; this page repeats “made love to Flora again”; see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N02` Sequence D).
  - LIKELY: adds to the animal POV cluster (cf. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Bob Martin” is a human rather than a product, and the mating language is metaphorical (unlikely).
- **Research needed:**
  - (none)
