I discussed certain passages with the man, and he was too guardedly ignorant in his contributions to our discussion. The chapter on the fall of the rupee you may omit. It is somewhat too sensational. Even these metallic problems have their melodramatic side. But would I have called him to me had it not been for money? Many a truth had been spoken, I reflected, as an epigram. Like something very far away in a great disused house, that may to the aching ear seem to be lifting a flag in some disused second cellar, my suspicion made an escaping movement, a movement of birth in a blank and distant subterrene of my mind. As I looked at him I realised that no single dish would satisfy the man. He would be, even to start with, for a course of soup, and then another of fishes, as my namesake said, and another of birds. I have never met any really wicked person before. I feel rather frightened. I am so afraid he will look just like every one else.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: “the man” (consulted about passages; evasive/ignorant).
  - LIKELY: narrator’s “namesake” is St Paul (1 Corinthians “another of fishes… another of birds”).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - LIKELY: “Many a truth had been spoken… as an epigram.” echoes the proverb “Many a true word is spoken in jest” (attested in Chaucer: “Ful ofte in game a sooth I have herd seye”).
  - CERTAIN: “another of fishes… another of birds” is 1 Corinthians 15:39 (KJV) → narrator turns it into a menu-courses joke by adding “soup” ahead of it.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Money as driver (“had it not been for money?”); suspicion + fear of wickedness.
  - Editing/omission (“fall of the rupee” chapter; “too sensational”).
  - Appetite metaphor (no single dish would satisfy).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Paranoid self-analysis; heightened moral fear; metaphor-dense interiority.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: wills/money cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md (documents + inheritance talk).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Page 18’s “money” context is later shown to be unrelated to legal documents/inheritance threads.
- **Research needed:**
  - (none)
