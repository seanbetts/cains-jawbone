After I might just as easily have been a literary bloke, like Jeremy Taylor or Eugene Sue. I told myself that all art was one. There might be superficial differences in their work, but they had, in the words of the old song, gone the same way home. When was it? Why, to-day, if I mistook not. I felt I must take a grip of my failing, in so far, that was, as it distorted the time factor. But in that case I knew I was right. To think of time---of all that retrospection, to think of to-day, and the ages continued henceforward. Have you guessed you yourself would not continue? Have you dreaded these earth beetles? But it occurred to me that to think of time with my delight would have got him guessing. I woke to the consciousness that I had done very little in my life. Not Dolittle but Didlittle. What was a did little? Didling, perhaps, or didlet. It was at the former that I woke to consciousness that morning.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Jeremy Taylor (1613–1667); died 13 Aug 1667 (EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Taylor,_Jeremy).
  - CERTAIN: Eugène Sue (1804–1857); died 3 Aug 1857 (EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Sue,_Eug%C3%A8ne).
- **Time markers:**
  - LIKELY: “to-day” may be 3 Aug (Sue’s death date; Taylor “attacked by fever” on 3 Aug 1667 per *The Living Age* (1871): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FaRIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA8), though Taylor’s death was 13 Aug 1667 (EB1911).
  - CERTAIN: “that morning” and waking “at the former” (= Didling, via wordplay).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - LIKELY: “gone the same way home” echoes the old song “All Go the Same Way Home” (title referenced as a song in *The Literary Digest*, 1914: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GFENffy9hgwC&pg=PA890&vq=%22All+Go+the%22).
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: orthography
- span: "Didling, perhaps"
- reading: "Dolittle -> Didlittle -> Didling (place-name hint)"
- confidence: med
- rationale: The narrator explicitly walks a word-chain from “Dolittle” toward “Didling”, framed as a wake-up location (“at the former”).
- falsifier: “Didling” is later shown not to be a place-name cue but a purely playful nonce-word in this voice.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): orthography
- span: "Didling, perhaps"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(orthography): Dolittle -> Didlittle -> Didling (place-name hint; “at the former”)"
- confidence: med
- why it matters: place -> a plausible place-name pointer that may become a cross-page anchor when matched with other location cues
- falsifiers:
  - “Didling” never resolves to a place-name or recurs as an anchor elsewhere
  - later context makes the chain purely self-deprecating wordplay with no geographic intent
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Time obsession; mortality (“you yourself would not continue”); “earth beetles” (burial imagery?).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Philosophical, self-lacerating; pun-driven.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: place anchor at Didling (if confirmed) could connect to other Sussex/Downs locations later.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Didling” is not meant as a place-name but purely a wordplay dead-end.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) Identify the “gone the same way home” song: “All Go the Same Way Home” (*The Literary Digest*, 1914): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GFENffy9hgwC&pg=PA890&vq=%22All+Go+the%22.
  - (Resolved/ambiguous) Why “to-day”: likely a 3 Aug anchor via Sue (death) + Taylor (fever onset), but Taylor’s actual death date is 13 Aug (EB1911).
