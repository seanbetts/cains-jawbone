I had seen, day after day, every sunlit or night obscured detail of the funny old house I had visited so many years ago. Through it, handsome, cadaverous and so quiet, had walked Death himself, tapping unnoticed at the very walls of the mansions of life ; trying here, failing there, lightly fingering for the sign of a breach. A tiny opening. Apparently the person who slept in the lock-up at that county town on the Severn, or perhaps woke, would hear this time. I had found that I could face my usual mixture of Peaberry Mysore and Blue Mountain. I had made certain havoc of two on toast, their silver skins laced with their golden blood. To think of the tiny Clem mixed up, nay, a prime mover, in such affairs. Useful, courteous little chip of a bat. He had hushed my brat for me when he was only six, one morning on which I had wanted to go out for a walk.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “tiny Clem” (likely Clement/Clem; childhood memory).
  - MAYBE: narrator’s “brat” (child; hushed by Clem).
  - MAYBE: person in the lock-up at a “county town on the Severn” (unidentified).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “day after day”; “so many years ago”; “one morning… when he was only six”.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Gothic “Death” imagery in an old house; “tapping… at the very walls”.
  - Confinement: lock-up in county town (Severn).
  - Coffee + breakfast: Peaberry Mysore + Blue Mountain; “two on toast” with “silver skins” and “golden blood” (food ID unclear).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Lyrical, metaphoric “Death” register mixed with domestic routine (coffee/food).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: connects to the Clement/Clem thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md) via the nickname “Clem”.
  - MAYBE: functions as retrospective “Clem” backstory (Sequence C in `Order/hypotheses.md`’s `N03` block) that can sit adjacent to either the instruction/pills beat (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md) or the house/jasmine suspicion beat (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md) once a phrase-level anchor repeats.
  - MAYBE: overlaps Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md via the rare “Death… fingered” phrasing + Shrewsbury lock‑up/prison framing (“this time” the incarcerated person would/could not hear).
  - **Falsification check (2025-12-25):** scanned all page bodies for this page’s distinctive anchors (“Peaberry Mysore”, “Blue Mountain”, “hushed my brat”, “county town on the Severn”, “lock-up”, “tapping unnoticed”, “tiny opening”) and found no repeats beyond this page → keep unplaced within `N03` until a second independent anchor emerges.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Clem” is later clearly a different person than “Clement” on Page 3 (surname/role mismatch).
  - If the “Death… fingered” + Shrewsbury lock‑up echo is shown to be a detachable quotation or a reused motif across unrelated voices.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved/LIKELY) “county town on the Severn” likely refers to Shrewsbury (county town of Shropshire; situated on the river Severn) (EB1911 “Shrewsbury”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Shrewsbury). “tapping… at the very walls” reads as Death-as-burglar metaphor rather than a specific named case (no clear external source yet).
  - Identify what “two on toast” refers to (food clue).
  - Identify whether “Death’s clumsy fingered” / “lightly fingering for the sign of a breach” is a detachable quotation (currently `stalled`; see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
