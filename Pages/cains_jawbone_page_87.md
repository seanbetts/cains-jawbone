        Of the old bold mate of Henry Morgan. 


My guest has, I think, a Byzantine beauty, as of a golden snake. Is she, or is she not, a little pale about the Gills? Sanders comes into view again, seemingly improved by his lunar visit. He props himself and gazes out to the northwest over the water of the little bay, drinking it all in. I follow his gaze and see, as Henry saw when he was at home in Woodstock, twisted trees in front of the thick-windowed little house, and a foreground of exquisitely coloured vegetation with somewhat the consistency of fur stoles : a breast of the hills under a long cloud. I have given her nothing at all. She has let me see the original of the dead man’s letter. It is funny, it is rather fearful, to feel a wet skeleton hand putting hers into mine. Why, I wonder? Not that it can really be skeleton yet ; it must be---worse : a loathsome mass of detestable putrescence.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: guest (unnamed “she”; described as “Byzantine beauty” and “pale about the Gills”).
  - CERTAIN: Sanders (named; reappears; gazes NW over a bay).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (referenced as being “at home in Woodstock”).
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - MAYBE: “dead man” whose letter is shown (could relate to `P59` on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: “little bay” / water view (northwest).
  - MAYBE: Woodstock (as Henry’s home reference).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Yeats continuation: “But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet / Of Cathleen the daughter of Houlihan” — “The Song of Red Hanrahan” (*In the Seven Woods*, 1903), Page:In_the_Seven_Woods,_Yeats,_1903.djvu/32; CJ substitutes “Of the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.”
  - MAYBE: Henry Morgan (historical privateer/pirate) invoked via the CJ substitution.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Coastal/bay imagery (twisted trees, thick-windowed house, hills under cloud).
  - “dead man’s letter” prop (possible continuity with death/letter threads).
  - Hand/decomposition imagery (“wet skeleton hand… putrescence”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Lyrical landscape description abruptly flips into visceral corpse-imagery.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: preceded by Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md (quote continuation).
  - MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md is another `N13` episode (host/guest poisoning) but not necessarily adjacent; keep pending until a phrase-level anchor repeats.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Of the old bold mate of Henry Morgan” is a separate allusion rather than the continuation of the prior quotation.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify who Sanders is (and whether he recurs in other “coastal” pages).
