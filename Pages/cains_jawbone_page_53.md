So far the mind had been ambling, if I may dare the expression ; moving forward ungainly, as if by one hemisphere at a time. But now I keenly wondered how we should agree, myself and this well-fed swine that had just been introduced to me. He was obviously in drink, and none the worse for that : the better indeed for my purpose. The old fellow’s face seemed vaguely familiar, though I am not good at faces. Suddenly I remembered that white bear which jutted from his chin like an undercurving wave. It should have been recognisable a mile off, from weekly reminders in the more ecstatic newspapers, as that of Sir Paul Trinder, whose furor loquendi had cause him for twenty years to adhere loudly to every ebbing cause in town. He was also, if I mistook not, some sort of chartered lecturer at obscure seats, one might almost call them stools, of learning. Such a man, it might be argued, was no one’s enemy but his own ; but, oh, what a bitter enmity that could be.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Sir Paul Trinder.
  - LIKELY: “Sir Paul Trinder” is a literary allusion (not a real public figure): Walter Besant’s novel *Herr Paulus* (1888) includes “Sir Paul Trinder, Baronet.” https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sYYpAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA264&vq=%22Sir+Paul+Trinder%22
  - MAYBE: narrator/interviewer (same as Page 52).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Interview dynamics: “introduced to me”; target is “in drink” and useful for narrator’s purpose.
  - Public persona: “furor loquendi” and fad-cause attachment “for twenty years”.
  - Academia satire: “chartered lecturer” at “obscure… stools of learning”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Contemptuous, ornate metaphor (“white bear” beard; “well-fed swine”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md as a subsequent “subject introduced” beat in the same `N25` inquiry.
  - LIKELY: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md sits between Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md and this page as part of the forecast “commentary… page after page” papers run (fallback: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md if p57 is falsified).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md’s interview scene and this Trinder introduction are later anchored to incompatible settings/participants, indicating different narrators.
- **Research needed:**
  - Determine whether the “white bear” beard detail also appears in *Herr Paulus* (vs being CJ-specific satire layered onto the borrowed name).
