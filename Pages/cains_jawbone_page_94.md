Naturally I looked up. And I tell you I found it awe-inspiring enough to actually see my own name through the window, printed there in great letters for the gaze of all and sundry. With a blush I concentrated again on Henry, and asked myself if his recent activities did or did not constitute the darbs. With a final flirt at the fringe, the other tapped and scattered the saintly ashes. Agriculture was to take back her own, it seemed, and I rejoiced to have my last night of the bent broad back. I couldn’t think why I became suddenly aware of Yeats ; and then it came to me : we find heartedness among men that ride upon horses. It was here, of course, they commemorated Colonel Anthony every year. Good luck to him. Really I didn’t like the children. A little he and she bounced in, half settling on my side like sparrows, and devirginating a bag of gum prunes as they bounced. How could I concentrate? And Henry was waiting for me.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”; sees own name on the window).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; narrator returns attention to him; “Henry was waiting for me”).
  - MAYBE: “the other” (scatters “saintly ashes”).
  - CERTAIN: Colonel Anthony (commemorated annually).
  - CERTAIN: two children (unnamed “he” and “she”; gum prunes).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Yeats allusion “we find heartedness among men that ride upon horses” (source to confirm).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Name-as-sign: narrator sees their own name printed in a window (strong identity anchor if the name can be read elsewhere).
  - Ashes/dust/earth: “saintly ashes” + “Agriculture… take back her own”.
  - Distraction by children (gum prunes) while trying to focus on Henry.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-conscious embarrassment (blush at seeing name) + impatience with children.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: belongs with Henry segments where the narrator is time-pressured and easily distracted.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “name in the window” is not the narrator’s own but a place/sign misread.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the Yeats line/source and whether it encodes a date/place.
  - Identify who “Colonel Anthony” is and what annual commemoration this refers to.
  - Clarify what “the darbs” means here (term/slang).
