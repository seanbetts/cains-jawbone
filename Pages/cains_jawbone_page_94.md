Naturally I looked up. And I tell you I found it awe-inspiring enough to actually see my own name through the window, printed there in great letters for the gaze of all and sundry. With a blush I concentrated again on Henry, and asked myself if his recent activities did or did not constitute the darbs. With a final flirt at the fringe, the other tapped and scattered the saintly ashes. Agriculture was to take back her own, it seemed, and I rejoiced to have my last night of the bent broad back. I couldn’t think why I became suddenly aware of Yeats ; and then it came to me : we find heartedness among men that ride upon horses. It was here, of course, they commemorated Colonel Anthony every year. Good luck to him. Really I didn’t like the children. A little he and she bounced in, half settling on my side like sparrows, and devirginating a bag of gum prunes as they bounced. How could I concentrate? And Henry was waiting for me.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”; sees own name on the window).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; narrator returns attention to him; “Henry was waiting for me”).
  - MAYBE: “the other” (scatters “saintly ashes”).
  - CERTAIN: Colonel Anthony (commemorated annually).
  - CERTAIN: two children (unnamed “he” and “she”; gum prunes).
  - LIKELY: narrator surname is King (schoolboy jibe “Kipling” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md suggests K(LIP)ING = King + “lip”; fits “my own name” window-sign).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Yeats, “At Galway Races” (*Responsibilities*, 1916): “And we find hearteners among men / That ride upon horses.” (Page:Yeats_Responsibilities_1916.djvu/128) — CJ paraphrases “hearteners” as “heartedness”.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Name-as-sign: narrator sees their own name printed in a window (LIKELY “KING”; see Entities).
  - LIKELY: Colonel Anthony refers to (Lt-)Col. Anthony St. Leger (Doncaster’s annual St. Leger Stakes, instituted 1776): Nuttall “Doncaster” (“called after Colonel St. Leger… instituted them in 1776”) + *Alumni Oxonienses* notes his brother Anthony founded the St. Leger Stakes in 1776 (The_Nuttall_Encyclopædia/D; Page:Alumni_Oxoniensis_(1715-1886)_volume_4.djvu/12).
  - Ashes/dust/earth: “saintly ashes” + “Agriculture… take back her own”.
  - Distraction by children (gum prunes) while trying to focus on Henry.
  - LIKELY: “the darbs” = slang “a darb” (“a fine thing/person”): cf. “You’re a darb” (Hammett, *The Dain Curse*, Page:Dashiell_Hammett_-_The_Dain_Curse.pdf/241) and “I’ve got some darbs” (Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises*, Page:The_sun_also_rises_-_Hemingway,_Ernest,_1899-1961.pdf/111).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-conscious embarrassment (blush at seeing name) + impatience with children.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md (Henry is “waiting for me” here; p85 then “drove Henry home, and left him”).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “name in the window” is not the narrator’s own but a place/sign misread.
- **Research needed:**
  - (none)
