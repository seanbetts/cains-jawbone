She said it didn’t matter what they had done, because she was still an M.D., and she’d got another one. That was he. She showed us some delicate undercoats, all raw liver colour, very lovely, and proved it. But she had, too, a passion for getting new things, and I was sorry for his sake. After all, in all my life with him, I had only had one coat, and that an inherited one. True, it was long and graceful, and fitted beautifully, which was more than could be said for some of hers. Combe, I had always thought, was where one pottered after rabbits. But there was a George too, because he said so. He called him a Free Knowledgist, though it didn’t seem to me he gave much away. He said this was his last day. I didn’t care. But I heard them say they were two all for that year ; she said one of his was vicarious and I could not understand what the vicar had to do with it. They made a bet.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: unnamed “she” (claims she is still an M.D. and has “another one”).
  - MAYBE: unnamed “he” (“That was he.”; says it’s his last day).
  - CERTAIN: George (surname unclear; “because he said so”).
  - CERTAIN: Combe (likely George Combe reference; needs confirmation).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Credentials: “still an M.D.” + “got another one”.
  - Clothes: undercoats “raw liver colour”; narrator’s single inherited coat.
  - Betting + scoring: “two all for that year”; “vicarious” misunderstanding.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Naïve literalism (vicarious → vicar); plain-spoken class contrast on clothing.
  - MAYBE: animal-coded voice (coat/undercoat language; “pottered after rabbits”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: belongs with other bet/points pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later reveals “M.D.” isn’t an academic degree but another acronym used repeatedly by this narrator.
- **Research needed:**
  - Confirm whether “George Combe” (phrenology) is intended and what “Free Knowledgist” means.
  - What does “two all for that year” refer to (sport/contest/scoreboard)?
