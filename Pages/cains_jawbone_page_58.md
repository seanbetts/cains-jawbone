Considering it was my name month, I wasn’t having too much luck. Henry, though a bit on the spectacular side---to fly the viscera of his third, of the old family lawyer, at his small flagstaff, a little argued the exhibitionist---was sane enough. And this stranger, to judge by the over-vague conversation he began to force on me---different in this from the agriculturist, who had been utterly silent save for the burning question, and the brats who had only uttered mutually---was distinctly nuts. Nuts in May, how Freudian. Be not a Freud ; thy help is near. But was it? Henry was in desperate case, and this other was short-sighted enough not to realise that I should care. The former was stooping over the cooling remains of his fourth---the rash intruding charlady---when there came a horribly official knock at the little blue door. (Was it Inspector Barraclough, or only some stolid-witted local?) But little the latter cared. He went on talking about Browning.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - MAYBE: “old family lawyer” (Henry’s third victim; unnamed).
  - MAYBE: “rash intruding charlady” (Henry’s fourth victim; unnamed).
  - MAYBE: “this stranger” (talkative; short-sighted).
  - MAYBE: Inspector Barraclough (named as possible visitor; likely a literary nod to W. Pett Ridge’s *A Breaker of Laws* (1900), with “Mr. Arthur Barraclough” introduced by an Inspector).
- **Time markers:**
  - LIKELY: “my name month” = May (reinforced by the “Nuts in May” children’s-game reference; EB1911 “Children’s Games” notes “Nuts in May” as a named game: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Children%27s_Games).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Murder-counting: Henry’s “third” and “fourth” victims explicitly tallied.
  - Official pressure: knock at “little blue door”; inspector vs local.
  - Psychoanalysis pun: “Nuts in May… Freudian” (children’s singing-game line: “Here we go gathering nuts in May…”; Kipling, *A Diversity of Creatures*: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Diversity_of_Creatures/The_Village_that_Voted_the_Earth_was_Flat) + “Be not a Freud” punning “Be not afraid, thy help is near” (Words of Anthems Used in Westminster Abbey (1878), p. 109: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FD9GAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA109&vq=%22thy+help+is+near%22).
  - Literature: stranger keeps talking about Browning.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Darkly comic; enumerates murders; pun-heavy.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: strengthens Henry-occurrence cluster (explicit corpse context).
  - MAYBE: links to Browning-heavy pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later pages show this Henry is distinct (different setting/timeline) from other Henry clusters.
- **Research needed:**
  - Confirm whether “my name month” implies the narrator’s own name (month-name as personal name) or only a calendar pointer (month = May suggested by “Nuts in May”).
