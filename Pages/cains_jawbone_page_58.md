Considering it was my name month, I wasn’t having too much luck. Henry, though a bit on the spectacular side---to fly the viscera of his third, of the old family lawyer, at his small flagstaff, a little argued the exhibitionist---was sane enough. And this stranger, to judge by the over-vague conversation he began to force on me---different in this from the agriculturist, who had been utterly silent save for the burning question, and the brats who had only uttered mutually---was distinctly nuts. Nuts in May, how Freudian. Be not a Freud ; thy help is near. But was it? Henry was in desperate case, and this other was short-sighted enough not to realise that I should care. The former was stooping over the cooling remains of his fourth---the rash intruding charlady---when there came a horribly official knock at the little blue door. (Was it Inspector Barraclough, or only some stolid-witted local?) But little the latter cared. He went on talking about Browning.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - MAYBE: “old family lawyer” (Henry’s third victim; unnamed).
  - MAYBE: “rash intruding charlady” (Henry’s fourth victim; unnamed).
  - MAYBE: “this stranger” (talkative; short-sighted).
  - MAYBE: Inspector Barraclough (named as possible visitor).
- **Time markers:**
  - MAYBE: “my name month” (month-name clue; possibly May implied).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Murder-counting: Henry’s “third” and “fourth” victims explicitly tallied.
  - Official pressure: knock at “little blue door”; inspector vs local.
  - Psychoanalysis pun: “Nuts in May… Freudian”; “Be not a Freud” (be-not-afraid).
  - Literature: stranger keeps talking about Browning.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Darkly comic; enumerates murders; pun-heavy.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: strengthens Henry-occurrence cluster (explicit corpse context).
  - MAYBE: links to Browning-heavy pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later pages show this Henry is distinct (different setting/timeline) from other Henry clusters.
- **Research needed:**
  - Interpret “name month” (does it imply narrator named May/June/etc?).
  - Identify whether Inspector Barraclough is a real or fictional detective reference.
