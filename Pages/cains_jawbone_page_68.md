Out cascaded the darling young. It was no tragedy ; that was, no tragedy comparable with the fire here in the Latham Chapel in 1906. Yet, I supposed, to wantonly look back like that buttered no parsnips. Just like reverting to old tunes after they were damned and dead : how often had I not caught myself whistling Alexander’s Ragtime Wedding Feast in my frugal bath. I felt that Henry was about all I could hope to cope with, or with whom, if you like, I could hope to cope. I was the more fed up, therefore, with the incursion of an untidy fellow, a myopic-looking creature, who clumsily stepped on my foot and touched a chord of memory at the same time. Surely this has eavesdropped at my last crucial meeting with the old man. It mattered little enough, of course. But that sort of thing was like a mosquito about the ears, making Kreisler on his little fiddle. It distracted.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: Henry (mentioned as the main person narrator can “cope with”; identity unclear vs other Henrys).
  - CERTAIN: “old man” (unnamed; narrator’s “last crucial meeting” with him).
  - CERTAIN: untidy myopic-looking fellow (unnamed; steps on narrator’s foot; possible eavesdropper).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Latham Chapel (location “here”; site of a 1906 fire).
  - CERTAIN: Selby Abbey (church of St Mary and St German), Selby, Yorkshire — 19–20 Oct 1906 fire began “in the Latham chapel adjoining the north choir aisle” (EB1911): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Selby.
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: reference to Latham Chapel fire in 1906 (historical anchor for this place).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Alexander’s Ragtime Wedding Feast” riffs on Irving Berlin’s “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” (1911) (CJ swaps “Band” for “Wedding Feast” but treats it as an “old tune” to whistle).
  - CERTAIN: Kreisler (violinist) invoked via mosquito/fiddle metaphor.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Nostalgia/reversion (“old tunes… damned and dead”).
  - Surveillance/paranoia: eavesdropping at “last crucial meeting”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Irritated, inward; sensory trigger (stepped-on foot → memory chord).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md as a daytime/awake trigger that leads into the late-night “collect myself” aftermath reflection.
  - MAYBE: earlier than the Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md letter thread as setup (crucial meeting + suspected eavesdropper).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “old man” is unrelated (generic) and no shared unique details emerge.
- **Research needed:**
  - Resolved: “Latham chapel” is within Selby Abbey (Selby, Yorkshire); fire 19–20 Oct 1906 (EB1911).
