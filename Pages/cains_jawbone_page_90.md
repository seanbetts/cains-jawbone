While my mind had been thus far away, a grotesque looking old gentleman had fluttered like a bat to the seat between us, and now deposited, with the bitter sang-froid of the unworldly, a dilapidated deer-stalker of pinkish tweed upon the glacial parquet. I thought I knew the type : learned in a macabre way, even distinguished ; one who was rich enough to remain unspotted by convention, and who yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force, gold of course, for the undoing of a materialistic world. Gathering a fungus in the other golden ruin before me, I considered within myself what such an obvious hermit could be doing among the brilliant lights of this notoriously soigné place. A dog was patently sorrowing in the distance. The two had their heads close together. The poor brute’s howling bothered me, and I was glad when it ceased. You will, Oscar, you will. Whistler’s jibe I had always taken personally. Was all my endeavour to be in the future? Would I never do anything in the present? It all seemed so fatuous.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: grotesque old gentleman (unnamed; bat-like; deer-stalker hat).
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - CERTAIN: sorrowing/howling dog (in the distance).
  - CERTAIN: Oscar (addressed directly).
  - MAYBE: two people with “heads close together” (offstage; who quiet the dog).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: a “notoriously soigné” venue with “glacial parquet” (restaurant/club vibe).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “You will, Oscar, you will.” (Whistler to Wilde; Frank Harris, *Oscar Wilde, His Life and Confessions* (1916), Ch. 4).
  - CERTAIN: “a thousand chariots… gold of course” — Robert Browning, “Love Among the Ruins” (*Men and Women*, 1855), stanza 13 (Page:Men_and_Women,_Volume_1_-_Browning_(1855).djvu/16).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Deer-stalker + fungus + parquet suggests a high-society dining scene.
  - Dog sorrow/howling as an auditory scene anchor.
  - Future vs present anxiety (endeavour always “in the future”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md (same “old gentleman” / hunting-food register).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “ancient” on Page 89 is clearly not the same figure as this old gentleman.
- **Research needed:**
  - Interpret the “other golden ruin” metaphor (fungus + “golden ruin”).
