I always feel a bit dazed on these occasions, and was so then. But it was pleasant to collect oneself, and count one’s burdens---above and beneath, and to one’s hand as it were. I did so. Yet I felt dazed. As I have said, I always did. I was developing a bit of a yen for Henry, though this was my first introduction to him. I am a simple soul, and I must confess that I was rather thrilled. It seemed that here was a man of no ordinary fascination, with a chin cleft like the toe-cap of a satyr’s boot, and a little group of show hairs behind each ear. Also he was doomed to destroy, for family reasons, and to keep on destroying. And I was still alone ; I could hardly expect otherwise in the circumstances. I echoed the words of the poet : 


        Bring Palamabron, horned priest, skipping upon
                the mountains,
        And silent Elynittria, the silver-bowed queen,

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - MAYBE: Palamabron; Elynittria (quoted mythic figures).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: William Blake, “Europe a Prophecy” — “A Prophecy” (“Bring Palamabron… And silent Elynittria…”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Europe_a_Prophecy/A_Prophecy
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Repeated dazedness (“on these occasions”).
  - Physical description of Henry (cleft chin; show hairs behind ears).
  - Henry framed as compelled to “destroy… for family reasons”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - “simple soul” register but highly allusive (poet quotation).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: add to Henry-occurrence cluster.
  - MAYBE: family-curse/motive thread for Henry’s repeated destruction.
  - CERTAIN: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md (Blake quote continuation: this page’s “Bring Palamabron… Elynittria…” → p13’s “Rintrah… Ocalythron.”).
  - MAYBE: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md (p49 “first introduction to Henry” → later guided/anticipatory scenes). Falsifier: “first introduction” refers to a different Henry than the p92/p42 guide/axis Henry, or p49 is fully accounted for by the Blake quote continuation to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the quoted lines are later shown to be misremembered/assembled (not a stable allusion anchor).
- **Research needed:**
  - None.
