I cannot help, even with this supreme distraction, thinking of my Babbie’s---dare I say my Babbie’s---hair as I last saw it, tiger-coloured, and all like the little springs of a fairy’s sofa. O toison, moutonnant jusque sur l’encolure! O boucles! O parfum charge de nonchaloir! Extase! If you take my meaning. She, at least, shows herself delightfully interested in Henry. I have always hated that these writers should be anonymous. What a tribe of them there has been, to be sure! But I have called them all by their names. Is it a foolish ecstasy to thrill when I see her long warm fingers taking off Henry’s cap and putting it on again, and trying him out on the table? My dear guest accepts a Rainbow. I clamour for it, and it comes. She explains, and her throat dimples, that she will take it because Lent is over. She never, she adds, will have a second Sundae in Lent. I must be besotted, for I think this amusing.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Babbie (beloved; narrator fixates on her hair).
  - MAYBE: Henry (present; has a “cap”; identity unclear vs other Henrys).
  - CERTAIN: “my dear guest” / “she” (likely Babbie, but confirm).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “Lent is over” (post-Lent/Easter framing; could be a date anchor).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Ô toison… Ô boucles…” (Baudelaire, “La Chevelure”, *Les Fleurs du mal*).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Desserts/drinks: “Rainbow”; “Sundae” rule during Lent.
  - Hair fetishisation + French quotation.
  - Writer/source obsession: narrator dislikes anonymous writers; insists on naming them.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Infatuated, performatively learned; food-ordering amid literary rapture.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: same sweets/“Sundae” cluster as Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md (and related bar/menu pages).
  - MAYBE: Henry here is the same “Henry” as the sundae/investigator thread; do not merge without more anchors.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Henry” is clearly a toy/animal/other object here, rather than a person.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify what a “Rainbow” is in this setting (drink/dessert/brand).
  - Identify “little springs of a fairy’s sofa” source (if quoted).
