It was just when the girl from the Asolo silk mills contended that morning was. There was something, I reflected, about the fashion, beastly, in the awful and literal sense of the word, as of equals, in which youth treated the young day. Heaven knew I would have been in bed, had not my head been surcharged with too perilous a stuff for sleep. I spent those six hours in an agony of recapitulation. Even as a tiny toddler, at old Mrs. Larkin’s school, when I was technically a mixed infant, I had shown signs of possessing these uncanny powers. In fact Mrs. Larkin might have called me Clare, so both voyant and audient was I. For a long time I sat and mused, looking into vacancy across the table. Gradually a realisation came to me that I would revisualise more connectedly on an assuaged stomach. I hoped for breakfast soon, nor was I to be disappointed. There was that silly girl of mine bursting into pang in the sausage, just like Pippa, as she always did.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Mrs. Larkin (school; “mixed infant” term).
  - CERTAIN: “girl from the Asolo silk mills” = Pippa (*Pippa Passes*; Asolo).
  - MAYBE: narrator’s “silly girl of mine” (domestic companion; relationship unclear).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “that morning”; waiting for breakfast; “those six hours”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Robert Browning, *Pippa Passes* (1841): Pippa is a “girl from the Asolo silk mills” and sings “The year’s at the spring… Morning’s at seven…”.
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: homophone
- span: "Clare, so both voyant and audient"
- reading: "Clare -> clair- (clairvoyant/clairaudient), a second-sight pun"
- confidence: high
- rationale: The page explicitly frames “uncanny powers” and then immediately plays “Clare” into “voyant/audient”.
- falsifier: “Clare” is later confirmed as a literal name/person here (not wordplay), making “voyant/audient” purely descriptive.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): homophone + orthography
- span: "Clare, so both voyant and audient"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(homophone): Clare -> clair- (clairvoyant/clairaudient), used as a second-sight self-description"
- confidence: high
- why it matters: narrator -> a high-signal punning tell for this breakfast/insomnia/second-sight voice
- falsifiers:
  - “Clare” is later shown to be a concrete person-name with no “clair-” intent
  - similar clair-/name puns do not recur for this narrator candidate
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Insomnia: head “surcharged with… perilous… stuff”.
  - Precognition/recapitulation: “uncanny powers”; “revisualise”.
  - Breakfast/satiation used to steady memory.
  - MAYBE: “bursting into pang in the sausage” as a distorted “burst into song” phrasing.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-mocking wordplay + claimed second-sight; breakfast domesticity.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to other Browning/Pippa references (e.g., Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Asolo/Pippa references resolve to unrelated in-world labels rather than Browning allusion.
- **Research needed:**
  - None (Pippa/Asolo allusion resolved).
