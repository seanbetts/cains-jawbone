I see that old dandy has purchased Cape Jasmine. Your gardenia is difficult at a distance to determine. It may be florida flore-pleno, double white. Why should I care? I am a very sick fellow. Gardenias! And there are also Gardener’s Garters, Phalaris arundinacea variegata. I am not at all well. He is clutched unwillingly into greeting old Mrs. Cave, our local Dame Quickly. They mince at one another. Yes, by James! James? Lo, how these fair immaculate women walk behind their jocund maker ; and we see slighted De Mauves, and that far different she, Gressie, the trivial Sphinx. We commiserate pass into the night from the loud banquet. Sorry. She urges me to the American mess. I wolf three-quarters, thinking of Quebec. Then I try her out, saying, with an airy lift of the spoon, this savours not of death, this hath a relish of eternity. Excellent, my dear Watson. But the leopard’s eyes do not bat a blink. Can she be guilty?

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: “old dandy” (unnamed).
  - CERTAIN: Mrs. Cave (local; likened to Dame Quickly).
  - MAYBE: “she” (urges narrator to the “American mess”; possible same as Mrs. Cave).
  - MAYBE: De Mauves; Gressie (names in a quoted passage?).
  - CERTAIN: Watson (Sherlock address reference).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Excellent, my dear Watson.”
  - MAYBE: “this savours not of death, this hath a relish of eternity” (source TBD).
  - MAYBE: “Lo, how these fair immaculate women… jocund maker… De Mauves… Gressie…” (source TBD).
  - CERTAIN: Dame Quickly (Shakespeare character).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Plants: Cape Jasmine (gardenia), Gardener’s Garters (Phalaris arundinacea variegata).
  - Illness: narrator repeatedly “not at all well”.
  - Food: “American mess”; Quebec association; soup-tasting test; suspicion (“Can she be guilty?”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Botanical precision; detective/quotational reflex (Watson).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: fits the plant-savvy narrator cluster (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the botanical detail is purely decorative and the voice differs sharply from other plant/poison pages.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the “relish of eternity” quotation.
  - Identify the “jocund maker / De Mauves / Gressie” passage and whether it anchors a specific author (“by James!”).
