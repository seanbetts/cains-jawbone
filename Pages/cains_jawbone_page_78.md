Then there disappeared the last rose flivers of the Prussian beast. He had died to stay this mimic artistry, and had not had an inkling of it. The lips were wiped clean. He handed me the new instrument, and stood half in furtive assurance and half, I thought, in fear. I felt I could afford to be suave. If you would care to verify the incident, pray do so. I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train. But this memorial of, as I thought, a soon to be dead woman’s silly wishes, now cleverly guided a little, by a stranger if falser hand, was even more so. We that did nothing study but the way to love each other, with which thoughts the day rose with delight to us and with them set, must, as Henry said, learn the hateful art, how to forget. Yes, I would have to learn that.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “he” (unnamed; provides a “new instrument” and may fear discovery).
  - CERTAIN: “soon to be dead woman” (unnamed; her “silly wishes” memorialised in a document).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (quoted again as a source for aphoristic lines).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - UNCLEAR: “soon to be dead woman” suggests impending death; whether murder is planned is not explicit here.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Documents/forgery: “mimic artistry”; “stranger if falser hand” guiding the memorial (will/diary link).
  - Travel: diary as “sensational” train reading.
  - Cleaning/alteration: “lips were wiped clean”; “new instrument” suggests rewriting/forgery workflow.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “We that did nothing study but the way to love each other…” = Thomas Carew (poem; printed in *The Poems and Masque of Thomas Carew* (1893)), p. 175: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E6B-X55lhFAC&pg=PA175&dq=We,+that+did+nothing+study&source=gbs_api.
  - CERTAIN: “learn the hateful art, how to forget” = Thomas Carew (same poem as the prior line; printed in *The Poems and Masque of Thomas Carew* (1893)), p. 175: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E6B-X55lhFAC&pg=PA175&dq=learn+the+hateful+art&source=gbs_api.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Suave self-assurance under threat; explicitly frames the situation as falsifiable (“verify… I never travel without my diary”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: belongs in the will/forgery cluster (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “instrument” is non-writing (e.g., medical) and “mimic artistry” refers to something other than handwriting/documents.
- **Research needed:**
  - Clarify what “lips were wiped clean” refers to (seal? mouth? lipstick? metaphor).
