I was true to time. I had, it occurred to me, been something of an automaton. But wasn’t I thrusting my head, when bent on such a business in this street, into the twin mouths of two lions, of Mycroft’s brother and of the pale but multitudinous Blake? Often as a schoolboy they had guyed my name to a whiskified objectionable one. Whiskified objectionable was Kipling. And I blubbed with my face in the mackintoshes. But I thanked heaven that their childish jibe was true. I was still going strong. The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep? I only knew that all the weary business was ended. I looked across the table and saw that she was asleep. A nice old thing. I put Henry’s keenness a few inches below the withered salt-cellar. I drove Henry home, and left him. A dog barked and mourned from the next room, but I could have all the stuff I wanted for ever.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry (driven home by narrator).
  - CERTAIN: “she” (unnamed; asleep at the table; described as “a nice old thing”).
  - CERTAIN: barking/mourning dog (next room).
  - MAYBE: “murderer… to be hung next day” (could be in-world or historical reference).
- **Places:**
  - LIKELY: Baker Street, London (the “two lions” appear to be Sherlock Holmes + Sexton Blake, both detective anchors tied to Baker Street; see research queue).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Mycroft’s brother (Sherlock Holmes allusion).
  - LIKELY: “the pale but multitudinous Blake” = Sexton Blake (fictional detective; a “pale” Holmes-like counterpart with a large story corpus; see research queue).
  - CERTAIN: Kipling (name-jibe reference).
  - CERTAIN: “The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?” = Whitman, “The Sleepers” (*Leaves of Grass*): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass_(1882)/The_Sleepers.
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: insertion
- span: "whiskified objectionable was Kipling"
- reading: "KING -> K(LIP)ING -> KIPLING (insert “lip” where whiskers are; “whiskified”)"
- confidence: med
- rationale: The text frames “Kipling” as a schoolboy jibe on the narrator’s name; inserting LIP into KING cleanly yields KIPLING.
- falsifier: Later context shows “Kipling” is only a literal insult/author reference with no name-transform intended.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): insertion + orthography
- span: "whiskified objectionable was Kipling"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(insertion): KING -> K(LIP)ING -> KIPLING (name-jibe; “lip” where whiskers are)"
- confidence: med
- why it matters: narrator -> a plausible self-name tell (“King”) for this detective-table voice segment
- falsifiers:
  - the narrator’s name is later explicitly not “King”
  - “Kipling” is shown to be used purely as an external author reference with no cryptic intent
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Time/automation (“true to time”; “automaton”).
  - Concealment: “put Henry’s keenness… below the… salt-cellar” (hiding an object/tool?).
  - Resolution/relief (“all the weary business was ended”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-referential about name-jibes; detective/allusion density; calm after stress.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md (p94 ends “Henry was waiting for me”; here the narrator then “drove Henry home, and left him”).
  - MAYBE: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md as the “weary business” resolution + table-concealment scene that Page 82’s table-staring comedown could echo (treat as tentative until a shared prop/phrase appears).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md is later anchored to a different narrator/setting (overlap only, no adjacency).
- **Research needed:**
  - (none)
