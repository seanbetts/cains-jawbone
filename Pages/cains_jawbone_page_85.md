I was true to time. I had, it occurred to me, been something of an automaton. But wasn’t I thrusting my head, when bent on such a business in this street, into the twin mouths of two lions, of Mycroft’s brother and of the pale but multitudinous Blake? Often as a schoolboy they had guyed my name to a whiskified objectionable one. Whiskified objectionable was Kipling. And I blubbed with my face in the mackintoshes. But I thanked heaven that their childish jibe was true. I was still going strong. The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep? I only knew that all the weary business was ended. I looked across the table and saw that she was asleep. A nice old thing. I put Henry’s keenness a few inches below the withered salt-cellar. I drove Henry home, and left him. A dog barked and mourned from the next room, but I could have all the stuff I wanted for ever.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry (driven home by narrator).
  - CERTAIN: “she” (unnamed; asleep at the table; described as “a nice old thing”).
  - CERTAIN: barking/mourning dog (next room).
  - MAYBE: “murderer… to be hung next day” (could be in-world or historical reference).
- **Places:**
  - MAYBE: London street near “twin mouths of two lions” (specific location unclear).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Mycroft’s brother (Sherlock Holmes allusion).
  - MAYBE: “the pale but multitudinous Blake” (identity unclear: author/poet vs another referent).
  - CERTAIN: Kipling (name-jibe reference).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Time/automation (“true to time”; “automaton”).
  - Concealment: “put Henry’s keenness… below the… salt-cellar” (hiding an object/tool?).
  - Resolution/relief (“all the weary business was ended”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-referential about name-jibes; detective/allusion density; calm after stress.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: pairs with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md (table setting + Henry + nearby dog).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Henry” here is not the same kind of figure as in Page 82 (or the settings diverge).
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the “twin mouths of two lions” place reference.
  - Identify “pale but multitudinous Blake” and what “whiskified objectionable was Kipling” is encoding.
  - Determine whether “murderer… to be hung next day” is a date anchor or in-world event.
