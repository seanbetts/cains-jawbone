I forgot why I was sitting and staring at the table. I felt battered. What could the batter be? Ah, I remembered. I had looked upon carnal, bloody and unnatural acts. And then, gazing at the steaming Lapsang before me, I became lost in reverie. Bartholomew pawed my ankles even, but I am not superstitious, to ladder danger, desiring sweet biscuits. They were so bad for him. He was the third dog I had had in London. I was afraid, I realised, that I did not notice him enough. It was the first dog I noticed, and at the very beginning. You might have thought it strange for me to say these things, but you never knew Henry. Whether as a human mistake or one o’ the brand o’ Cain, as the Poet Laureate says---and he served in both capacities---he knew his job. I felt as if great asses of mice were pressing down on my head, with all the cold weight of my certainty.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Bartholomew (dog; paws narrator’s ankles; “third dog… in London”).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; narrator comments on him directly).
  - MAYBE: Poet Laureate quoted re “brand o’ Cain” (source TBD).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: London (explicit).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “carnal, bloody and unnatural acts” (Shakespeare, *Hamlet*; Horatio’s summary).
  - MAYBE: “brand o’ Cain” attribution to “the Poet Laureate” (identify which and exact line).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Tea: steaming Lapsang; biscuits.
  - Dogs: “first dog… at the very beginning” vs “third dog… in London” (possible clue about beginnings).
  - Mental/physical pressure imagery (“great asses of mice… pressing down on my head”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Disoriented (“forgot why I was… staring”); guilt/weight-of-certainty framing.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: table-setting continues into Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md (both feature table, Henry, and a nearby barking dog).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Henry in Page 85 is clearly a different figure (e.g., different setting/role).
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify “great asses of mice” and “to ladder danger” phrasing.
  - Identify the Poet Laureate “brand o’ Cain” line and how it’s used here.
