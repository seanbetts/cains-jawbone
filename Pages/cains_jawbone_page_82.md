I forgot why I was sitting and staring at the table. I felt battered. What could the batter be? Ah, I remembered. I had looked upon carnal, bloody and unnatural acts. And then, gazing at the steaming Lapsang before me, I became lost in reverie. Bartholomew pawed my ankles even, but I am not superstitious, to ladder danger, desiring sweet biscuits. They were so bad for him. He was the third dog I had had in London. I was afraid, I realised, that I did not notice him enough. It was the first dog I noticed, and at the very beginning. You might have thought it strange for me to say these things, but you never knew Henry. Whether as a human mistake or one o’ the brand o’ Cain, as the Poet Laureate says---and he served in both capacities---he knew his job. I felt as if great asses of mice were pressing down on my head, with all the cold weight of my certainty.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Bartholomew (dog; paws narrator’s ankles; “third dog… in London”).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; narrator comments on him directly).
  - CERTAIN: Poet Laureate quote is John Masefield (“one o’ the brand o’ Cain… a human mistake…”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hyiuUvTx8-AC&pg=PA13&dq=brand+o%27+Cain&source=gbs_api.
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: London (explicit).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “carnal, bloody and unnatural acts” (Shakespeare, *Hamlet*; Horatio’s summary).
  - CERTAIN: “brand o’ Cain” / “human mistake” echo John Masefield (Poet Laureate) line “one o’ the brand o’ Cain for mate ’n’ a human mistake for cook”: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hyiuUvTx8-AC&pg=PA13&dq=brand+o%27+Cain&source=gbs_api.
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: anagram
- span: "great asses of mice"
- reading: "great asses of mice -> great masses of ice"
- confidence: high
- rationale: A clean near-anagram resolves the phrase into a fluent image that matches the surrounding “cold weight” framing.
- falsifier: A source is found showing “great asses of mice” is a fixed quotation/phrase here (no wordplay intended).

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): anagram + orthography
- span: "great asses of mice"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(anagram): great asses of mice -> great masses of ice"
- confidence: high
- why it matters: motif -> reinforces the “cold weight/pressure” image (and may hint that other odd word-boundaries hide simple anagrams)
- falsifiers:
  - “great asses of mice” is sourced as a direct quotation elsewhere (no pun intended)
  - “masses of ice” appears elsewhere explicitly, making this reading redundant as wordplay

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: anagram
- span: "to ladder danger"
- reading: "to ladder danger -> garden ladder (anagram; “to” may be grammatical filler)"
- confidence: med
- rationale: “ladder danger” is an exact anagram of “garden ladder”, and the page already contains domestic/table-register details that tolerate this kind of transformation.
- falsifier: A period source is found for “to ladder danger” as a fixed phrase/quotation (not an anagram).

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): anagram
- span: "to ladder danger"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(anagram): garden ladder (via anagram of “ladder danger”; “to” may be grammatical filler)"
- confidence: med
- why it matters: motif -> keeps the gardening/horticulture register active in this narrator’s table-scene voice
- falsifiers:
  - later text uses “ladder” non-punningly in this narrator’s voice (e.g., literal superstition about ladders)
  - a period source is found for “to ladder danger” as a fixed phrase/quotation (not an anagram)
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Tea: steaming Lapsang; biscuits.
  - Dogs: “first dog… at the very beginning” vs “third dog… in London” (possible clue about beginnings).
  - Mental/physical pressure imagery (“great asses of mice… pressing down on my head”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Disoriented (“forgot why I was… staring”); guilt/weight-of-certainty framing.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: could follow Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md within `N08` as a post-business table comedown (p85 ends with table concealment + resolution; here the narrator is again table-bound with “cold weight of my certainty” after witnessing “carnal, bloody and unnatural acts”).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Henry/dog/setting here is clearly incompatible with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md, or a stronger anchor places this page in a different narrator cluster.
- **Research needed:**
  - (none)
