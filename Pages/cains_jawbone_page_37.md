Death’s clumsy fingered, that was the really frightful thing : I had seen them, beneath a debonair smile, fumbling so long about their business. I realised that I would have to do something. This time, of course, the male incarcerated at the place of Hotspur’s death could not hear. I looked across the table to the great brimming bowl of yellow jasmine ; young Alexander had sent him up the night before with an invitation to a private view of the Paulo Post Avorticists. Then I glanced at the rococo mirror on my left. Well, my parents had seen to it, soon after birth, that I should be one ; but I had never, save during that week in Malta when I met Ronald Firbank and was a trifle jaundiced, been the other. It was terrible to sit there with only the table in front of me, and to know that murder had been committed. He would---I had sensed that---be intrinsicated and concealed, chamber within chamber ; if I durst open the bores, who would believe me?

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Alexander (sent invitation).
  - CERTAIN: “male incarcerated at the place of Hotspur’s death” points to Shrewsbury (Hotspur/Henry Percy killed there in 1403); likely Shrewsbury prison/gaol as the “place” of incarceration.
  - CERTAIN: Ronald Firbank; Malta.
  - LIKELY: “Paulo Post Avorticists” is wordplay: “paulo post” (“after a little while”) + “a Vorticists” → “post-Vorticists” (an “after the Vorticists” private view).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “the night before”.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Murder awareness: “to know that murder had been committed.”
  - Concealment: “intrinsicated and concealed, chamber within chamber”.
  - LIKELY: “intrinsicated” echoes Shakespeare’s “knot intrinsicate” (Cleopatra to the asp): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Antony_and_Cleopatra_(1921)_Yale/Text/Act_V
  - Evidence/weapon: “open the bores” reads as firearm language (Chambers 1908 defines *bore* as “the size of the cavity of a gun”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Boomerang_Brine
  - Yellow jasmine bowl; rococo mirror.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Forensic anxiety + ornate setting; identity remark (“my parents… I should be one… never… the other”) suggests a personal/biographical tell.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: fits the “jasmine” motif thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md).
  - MAYBE: overlaps Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md via the “Death… fingered” metaphor + Shrewsbury lock‑up/prison “this time” hearing contrast.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “bores/chambers” proves unrelated to a weapon/evidence mechanism.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) “the place of Hotspur’s death” points to Shrewsbury: EB1911 notes “In 1403 Henry Percy… was defeated and killed at Shrewsbury by Henry IV.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Shrewsbury
  - (Resolved) “Paulo Post Avorticists” reads as “paulo post” (“after a little while”) + “a Vorticists” → “post-Vorticists”: “Thus we say, I will see thee ‘paulo post,’ i.e. after a little while.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_I/Volume_VII/First_Epistle_of_John/Part_8
  - (Resolved) “open the bores” / “chamber within chamber” plausibly points to a firearm/evidence mechanism (Chambers: *bore* = “the size of the cavity of a gun”), and “intrinsicated” appears to echo Shakespeare’s “knot intrinsicate” (*Antony and Cleopatra*). No unique external source identified for the “one… other” biographical aside from this wording alone; treat as a narrator tell and revisit if repeated. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Boomerang_Brine ; https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Antony_and_Cleopatra_(1921)_Yale/Text/Act_V
  - Identify whether “Death’s clumsy fingered” is a detachable quotation (currently `stalled`; see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
