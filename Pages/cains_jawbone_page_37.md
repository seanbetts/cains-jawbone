Death’s clumsy fingered, that was the really frightful thing : I had seen them, beneath a debonair smile, fumbling so long about their business. I realised that I would have to do something. This time, of course, the male incarcerated at the place of Hotspur’s death could not hear. I looked across the table to the great brimming bowl of yellow jasmine ; young Alexander had sent him up the night before with an invitation to a private view of the Paulo Post Avorticists. Then I glanced at the rococo mirror on my left. Well, my parents had seen to it, soon after birth, that I should be one ; but I had never, save during that week in Malta when I met Ronald Firbank and was a trifle jaundiced, been the other. It was terrible to sit there with only the table in front of me, and to know that murder had been committed. He would---I had sensed that---be intrinsicated and concealed, chamber within chamber ; if I durst open the bores, who would believe me?

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Alexander (sent invitation).
  - MAYBE: “male incarcerated at the place of Hotspur’s death” (location pun; likely Shrewsbury).
  - CERTAIN: Ronald Firbank; Malta.
  - MAYBE: “Paulo Post Avorticists” (group/exhibit; name unclear).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “the night before”.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Murder awareness: “to know that murder had been committed.”
  - Concealment: “intrinsicated and concealed, chamber within chamber”.
  - Evidence/weapon: “open the bores” (suggests gun barrels/chambers).
  - Yellow jasmine bowl; rococo mirror.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Forensic anxiety + ornate setting; identity remark (“my parents… I should be one… never… the other”) suggests a personal/biographical tell.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: fits the “jasmine” motif thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “bores/chambers” proves unrelated to a weapon/evidence mechanism.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the “place of Hotspur’s death” clue and the intended prison/town.
  - What are the “Paulo Post Avorticists” (and is “Paulo” a clue)?
  - Interpret “open the bores” and the “one… other” biographical remark.
