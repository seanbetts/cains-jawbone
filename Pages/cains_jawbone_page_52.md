The cardinal was acquitted to-day of all complicity in the affair of the Queen’s diamond necklace. How quickly the quicksands of crime got hold of the mind’s feet. At that moment it seemed incredible that I had ever been an innocent child, gambolling among the daisies, and thinking, if I thought of it at all, that the grave would be as little as my bed. The door opened and shut. From what I already knew of the man who entered, I should have supposed cleaner limbs and an air more sinister. I explained my object, and told him to sit down and make himself comfortable with the papers. Coffee and sandwiches of Westphalian ham pleased him too obviously. Why cucumber sandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Yes, I felt, at my first sight of him, that the words before my eyes would form some sort of commentary, ironic perhaps, page after page, till the end of my interview, and even after.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “the cardinal” (Cardinal Louis de Rohan; Diamond Necklace affair).
  - MAYBE: interviewee (“man who entered”; young; papers).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day” tied to the cardinal’s acquittal (potential date anchor).
  - CERTAIN: “to-day” → May 31, 1786 (trial acquittal of Cardinal de Rohan; EB1911 “Diamond Necklace, The Affair of the”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Crime/innocence reflection (“quicksands of crime”).
  - Interview setting: door opens/shuts; “papers”; narrator supplies coffee + sandwiches.
  - Food tells: Westphalian ham; cucumber sandwiches (extravagance noted).
  - Meta-structure hint: “words before my eyes… commentary… page after page” (suggests a run of interview-pages).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Moralising, self-analytical; anticipates irony/commentary while questioning someone.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: start of the `N25` interview/papers run; precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md as a later/next “subject introduced” beat.
  - LIKELY: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md continues the Westphalian-ham + paper-reading scene dressing before the Trinder introduction on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md (fallback: if p57 is falsified as a different setting/voice, keep Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md).
  - MAYBE: same-voice echo with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md via shared “innocent child” phrasing + “ironic” framing (voice evidence only; do not assume adjacency between the debts vignette and this interview run).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md’s Sir Paul Trinder meeting is shown to be a different narrator/setting from this interview scene.
  - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md is later anchored to a different voice (ham/papers coincidence).
- **Research needed:**
  - None (date anchor resolved).
