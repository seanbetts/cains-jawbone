Next day I let Caroline Jasmine---what a name!---do her very damnedest for my guest. But I was doubtful of her influence all the while. What a man! Henry, I supposed, was about his business and concern, such as it was. What is removed drops horribly in a pail. Why should that stick in my head? Just because a tool I have used, and shall use again, turned, as it were, under my hand last week and said it? And what more had he said? Has anyone supposed it lucky to be born? I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it. That should be, I thought, a consolation for my patient. Surely such a confirmed old tub-thumper would not have had the wit to think out the Mithradates inoculation for himself, and put it into practice? Perish the thought, and the fellow. Also my ravishing correspondent would have told me. I found myself thinking with a strange weakness of the poet’s lines :


        But we have all bent low and low and kissed the
                quiet feet

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Caroline Jasmine (named; tends to narrator’s guest/patient).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; “about his business”).
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - MAYBE: guest/patient (unnamed; being treated “next day”).
  - MAYBE: “ravishing correspondent” (unnamed; informs narrator).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “Next day”.
  - CERTAIN: “last week”.
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - LIKELY: narrator has used a “tool” before and expects to use it again.
  - MAYBE: death-wish/intent language (“Perish the thought, and the fellow”; “just as lucky to die”).
  - MAYBE: poison-immunity tactic mentioned (“Mithradates inoculation”).
- **Means/method:**
  - MAYBE: poisoning/antidote logic (Mithradates-style tolerance building).
  - MAYBE: the “tool” echoes Whitman’s surgical image (anatomist’s/surgeon’s knife/saw) in “What is removed drops horribly in a pail.”
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “What is removed drops horribly in a pail.” — Walt Whitman, *Leaves of Grass* (“Song of Myself”), Page:Leaves_of_Grass_(1882).djvu/45.
  - CERTAIN: “But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet …” — W. B. Yeats, “The Song of Red Hanrahan” (*In the Seven Woods*, 1903), Page:In_the_Seven_Woods,_Yeats,_1903.djvu/32 (continues on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md with altered wording).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Jasmine name motif (Caroline Jasmine) in a run already heavy with jasmine/flowers.
  - Host/guest/patient framing echoes other “guest” poisoning setups (compare Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Over-precision/insistence about death (“and I know it”) + casual malice.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md (direct continuation of the quoted lines).
  - MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md is a thematic overlap (host/guest poisoning) but is not supported as an adjacent predecessor without a stronger shared anchor.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the poem quotation is reproduced elsewhere in full (no actual page-break continuity).
