Looking over at the sly sideways smile which seemed to fill all the foreground opposite me, I could not help recalling old Lord Pentarry and his minion. “Tools must be tooled in the de Quincey sense,” he had said, as he stood wiping the billhook on his smalls, over the welter that had once been so incomparable a lieutenant. I felt I could not do less. Maturity can always be depended on. Ripeness can be trusted. Young women are green : I spoke horticulturally. My metaphor was drawn from fruits. The scottish nobleman had also spoken of a green stick fracture. Green was the name of the victim. Those little golden escapes, those logical thoughts, came on me like stars upon some gloomy grove, as Henry said. And then arrived the blinding realisation that if I did not do the thing myself---and I am not that type---I would be merely robbing a whirlwind to reap a scorpion. I would have to think it over.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “Lord Pentarry” + his “minion” (anecdote/model of brutality; in-world vs allusive unclear).
  - CERTAIN: victim named Green (explicitly “the name of the victim”).
  - MAYBE: Scottish nobleman (unnamed; “green stick fracture” remark).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (quoted as a source for a simile).
  - MAYBE: “Pentarry” resembles the place-name Penterry (Monmouthshire; near Chepstow), but no person/title match found yet: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=la0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA57&dq=Penterry&source=gbs_api.
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - CERTAIN: billhook + “welter” over a slain “lieutenant” (described as a precedent/example).
  - LIKELY: narrator contemplating personally doing “the thing” with a named victim (Green).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: De Quincey “in the … sense” (likely *On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts*; confirm phrasing).
  - CERTAIN: “stars upon some gloomy grove” = Henry Vaughan, “They are all gone into the world of light” (*The Poems of Henry Vaughan*, 1896), p. 182: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Tn4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA182&dq=some+gloomy+grove&source=gbs_api.
  - LIKELY: “rob… a whirlwind… reap a scorpion” is deliberate proverb-scrambling (no fixed-source match yet; stalled — see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Green/ripeness/fruit metaphors used to justify action (“young women are green”).
  - “Green” as victim name + injury metaphor (“greenstick fracture”) + plant language.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-justifying moral calculus; frames murder as an adult/ripe duty; literate allusion density.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: leads into Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md (decision-to-act → “my first” murder aftermath).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Green” is revealed as a joke/reference rather than an in-world victim, or if the billhook scene is purely literary quotation.
- **Research needed:**
  - Stalled: no fixed-source match for “robbing a whirlwind to reap a scorpion” yet (see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
