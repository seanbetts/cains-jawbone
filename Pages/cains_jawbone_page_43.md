This is good. She accepts Lover’s Delight from me. She has spoken very little ; but she urges me to make trial of a Banana Split. Is there some esoteric meaning behind the titles? Now Ecky passes over to the Dawn. Alexander’s my name. They ca’d me Ecky when I was a boy. Eh, Ecky! Ye’re a awfu’ old man. Emotional stuff. Anyway Ecky has disappeared in the Dawn. I almost wish I took it. The hard stuff, I mean ; but it would ruin my hand. Where would my income be if Aquarius were to turn Gemini? She tells me a lot, each word huskily lisping over that round petulant vermilion lower lip, of a doctor friend of hers. I have only known her a few minutes ; but I hate to think she would change---her voice hits a pocket, just like a plane, when she talks of him---an honest station between King’s Cross and Edinburgh for---what is it?---being’s drone pipe, whose nostril turns to blight the strivelled stars and thicks the lusty breathing of the sun.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Alexander (narrator; nickname “Ecky”).
  - MAYBE: unnamed “she” (bar companion; could match Page 42’s woman).
  - MAYBE: “doctor friend of hers” (unnamed).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: King’s Cross.
  - CERTAIN: Edinburgh.
  - MAYBE: “an honest station between King’s Cross and Edinburgh” (clue; exact station TBD).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - “being’s drone pipe, whose nostril turns to blight the strivelled stars and thicks the lusty breathing of the sun” (source TBD).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Drinks/desserts as titles: “Lover’s Delight”, “Banana Split”, “the hard stuff”, “the Dawn”.
  - Hands/income dependence (“ruin my hand”).
  - Zodiac/astrology wordplay: Aquarius ↔ Gemini.
  - Scottish nickname/dialect framing (“Ecky”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-referential wordplay; astrological/handwriting sensitivity (possible link to “Aquarius” pen voice).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md via “Aquarius” motif.
  - MAYBE: links to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md via cocktail/bar setting and the same woman.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Aquarius/Gemini” is shown to be purely menu-wordplay with no pen/astrology continuity elsewhere.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the “being’s drone pipe…” quotation source.
  - Determine what “Ecky passes over to the Dawn” refers to (menu/drink/other).
  - Identify the intended “station between King’s Cross and Edinburgh” (if it is a clue).
