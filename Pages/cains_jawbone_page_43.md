This is good. She accepts Lover’s Delight from me. She has spoken very little ; but she urges me to make trial of a Banana Split. Is there some esoteric meaning behind the titles? Now Ecky passes over to the Dawn. Alexander’s my name. They ca’d me Ecky when I was a boy. Eh, Ecky! Ye’re a awfu’ old man. Emotional stuff. Anyway Ecky has disappeared in the Dawn. I almost wish I took it. The hard stuff, I mean ; but it would ruin my hand. Where would my income be if Aquarius were to turn Gemini? She tells me a lot, each word huskily lisping over that round petulant vermilion lower lip, of a doctor friend of hers. I have only known her a few minutes ; but I hate to think she would change---her voice hits a pocket, just like a plane, when she talks of him---an honest station between King’s Cross and Edinburgh for---what is it?---being’s drone pipe, whose nostril turns to blight the strivelled stars and thicks the lusty breathing of the sun.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Alexander (narrator; nickname “Ecky”).
  - MAYBE: unnamed “she” (bar companion; could match Page 42’s woman).
  - MAYBE: “doctor friend of hers” (unnamed).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: King’s Cross.
  - CERTAIN: Edinburgh.
  - LIKELY: St Neots (railway station/town) as “an honest station between King’s Cross and Edinburgh” clue (*To-day*, 1896): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gHdNAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22St.+Neots%22&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2 ; https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gHdNAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22King%27s+Cross%22&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Francis Thompson, *New Poems* (1897), p. 93: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SZo-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&dq=%22being%27s+drone+pipe%22 (source reads “being’s drone-pipe… blight the **shrivelled** stars…”).
  - CERTAIN: Robert Louis Stevenson & Lloyd Osbourne, *The Wrecker* (1892), Chapter 6: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Wrecker_(Stevenson)/Chapter_6 (includes “Alexander’s my name. They ca’d me Ecky when I was a boy…”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Drinks/desserts as titles: “Lover’s Delight”, “Banana Split”, “the hard stuff”, “the Dawn”.
  - LIKELY: “the Dawn” is a venue-name (also appears paired with “the Moon” on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md).
  - LIKELY: “Lover’s Delight” is a named ice-cream-parlour specialty (three cones on a sundae dish): *The Spatula* (1922) p. 23: https://books.google.com/books?id=_hZOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA23&dq=%22Lover%27s+Delight%22.
  - Hands/income dependence (“ruin my hand”).
  - Zodiac/astrology wordplay: Aquarius ↔ Gemini.
  - Scottish nickname/dialect framing (“Ecky”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-referential wordplay; astrological/handwriting sensitivity (possible link to “Aquarius” pen voice).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md via “Aquarius” motif.
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md (Moon/Dawn venue pair + “bad for the hand” ↔ “ruin my hand”; woman seated opposite → “Lover’s Delight”/Banana Split exchange).
  - MAYBE: links to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md via cocktail/bar setting and the same woman.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Aquarius/Gemini” is shown to be purely menu-wordplay with no pen/astrology continuity elsewhere.
- **Research needed:**
  - Determine what “Ecky passes over to the Dawn” refers to (menu/drink/other).
  - Confirm whether “station between King’s Cross and Edinburgh” is meant to be St Neots (vs another intermediate stop).
