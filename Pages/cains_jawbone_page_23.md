I hate seeing things like this in the paper. Bill to Solve the Traffic Problem. Bill to improve the Secondary Schools. I am never asked. I am not qualified. It is all so sudden. I find it hard to reconcile my guest with the Duchess of that name, though I know how popular everything to do with the Wimpole Street singer is just now, except perhaps her singing. Toll slowly, a match box rhythm. Bryant and, of course, May. Rub gently, she is here, under the snow. Poor Oscar. Nor will the ends drop off. Nor can her eyes go out. Pure Francis Thompson. He sold matches. But I feel I am letting the dear girl down. There’s a contrast : Fidelia Faustina Flora Blackwood, sister of Ebenezer Blackwood, which of course it is. She marches by on muscular pink hocks. The thought of that evening in the Left Luggage Office parches me, makes my heart beat differently. I must say I envy Alexander having his first, and perhaps his second, in there. I think wistfully of the poet’s lines: 

        But rum alone’s the tipple, and the heart’s delight

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Bryant & May (match company reference).
  - CERTAIN: Francis Thompson (poet; “sold matches” claim).
  - MAYBE: Oscar (likely Oscar Wilde reference).
  - MAYBE: “Wimpole Street singer” (Elizabeth Barrett Browning reference).
  - MAYBE: “my guest” (shares a name with a Duchess; unclear which).
  - CERTAIN: Fidelia Faustina Flora Blackwood; Ebenezer Blackwood (named as siblings).
  - MAYBE: Alexander (has “first” and “second” in the Left Luggage Office).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Bryant and… May” (match brand).
  - MAYBE: “Toll slowly… match box rhythm” / “Rub gently…” (match-lighting imagery; matchgirls context?).
  - MAYBE: “But rum alone’s the tipple, and the heart’s delight” (continues on Page 24; source TBD).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Matches: matchbox rhythm; “ends” not dropping; “eyes” not going out; “under the snow” (match head imagery).
  - Rail/travel: Left Luggage Office.
  - Alcohol: rum line.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Rapid associative allusion; self-reproach about “letting the dear girl down”.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: matches/Bryant & May motif could cluster with other “May” and “girl” references (watch for matchgirl strike allusions).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Bryant & May is later shown to be a person-pair rather than the match company.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the rum/Cathleen lines source (poem/song) and whether it encodes an Irish/date anchor.
  - Clarify the Blackwood names (people, animals, or coded reference) and the Left Luggage Office “first/second”.
  - Identify which Duchess shares a name with the narrator’s “guest”.
