I hate seeing things like this in the paper. Bill to Solve the Traffic Problem. Bill to improve the Secondary Schools. I am never asked. I am not qualified. It is all so sudden. I find it hard to reconcile my guest with the Duchess of that name, though I know how popular everything to do with the Wimpole Street singer is just now, except perhaps her singing. Toll slowly, a match box rhythm. Bryant and, of course, May. Rub gently, she is here, under the snow. Poor Oscar. Nor will the ends drop off. Nor can her eyes go out. Pure Francis Thompson. He sold matches. But I feel I am letting the dear girl down. There’s a contrast : Fidelia Faustina Flora Blackwood, sister of Ebenezer Blackwood, which of course it is. She marches by on muscular pink hocks. The thought of that evening in the Left Luggage Office parches me, makes my heart beat differently. I must say I envy Alexander having his first, and perhaps his second, in there. I think wistfully of the poet’s lines: 

        But rum alone’s the tipple, and the heart’s delight

  - MAYBE: “my guest” (shares a name with a Duchess; unclear which).
  - CERTAIN: Fidelia Faustina Flora Blackwood; Ebenezer Blackwood (named as siblings).
  - CERTAIN: Name meanings (Chambers 1908 “Christian Names”): Fidelia = “faithful”; Faustina = “fortunate”; Flora = “flowers”; Ebenezer = “stone of help”. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/The_More_Common_English_Christian_Names
  - MAYBE: Alexander (has “first” and “second” in the Left Luggage Office).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Bryant and… May” (match brand).
  - CERTAIN: Oscar Wilde, “Requiescat”: “Tread lightly, she is near / Under the snow” → here adapted as “Rub gently, she is here, under the snow” (match-striking cue). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Writings_of_Oscar_Wilde/Volume_1/Requiescat
  - CERTAIN: Francis Thompson, “Dream-Tryst”: “Nor can her eyes go out.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Thompson)/Dream-Tryst
  - CERTAIN: Francis Thompson biographical detail: he “earn[ed] a few pence by selling matches” (Catholic Encyclopedia, 1913): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Francis_Thompson
  - CERTAIN: John Masefield, “Captain Stratton’s Fancy” — “But rum alone’s the tipple, and the heart’s delight …” (continues on Page 24 with a substituted next line): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Captain_Stratton%27s_Fancy.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Matches: matchbox rhythm; “ends” not dropping; “eyes” not going out; “under the snow” (match head imagery).
  - Rail/travel: Left Luggage Office.
  - “Hocks” suggests an animal/quadrupled anatomy (Chambers 1908: hough/hock = hind-leg joint of a quadruped). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Holywell_Hurry
  - Alcohol: rum line.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Rapid associative allusion; self-reproach about “letting the dear girl down”.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: matches/Bryant & May motif could cluster with other “May” and “girl” references (watch for matchgirl strike allusions).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Bryant & May is later shown to be a person-pair rather than the match company.
- **Research needed:**
  - Resolved: rum/Cathleen lines trace to Masefield, “Captain Stratton’s Fancy” (see Indexes/quotes.md).
  - Resolved (partial): “Left Luggage Office” is the railway-station luggage office for deposited baggage (e.g., “booking office, left-luggage office…” in *When William Came*, Chapter II). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/When_William_Came/Chapter_II. “First/second” remains ambiguous.
  - Identify which Duchess shares a name with the narrator’s “guest”.
