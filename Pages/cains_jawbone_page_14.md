My ears were becoming attuned, and for the first time I heard clearly what the woman was saying : “Are you going to leave everything to me?” she asked, and I could have sworn her companion started. Then seeing, or thinking he saw, his mistake, he answered : “You must do just as you think fit, May.” After all it was none of my business. Some fragments of dejected flesh still lay among the rests of the spilled wine. At my sign, Henry stooped and made all clean again. And there was no immediate call for me to listen further, for there came a pause during which both seemed busy with their thoughts. And I too thought. The voice was like and yet not like that of Janetta Sheringham. How we had laughed that day in the hay field when John sat on the buttered rolls, and we devised games out of straws, and we thought the cricket a war-horse, barded and chaufroned too, real fairy, with wings all right.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: May (named; addressed directly).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (stoops/cleans at narrator’s sign; subordinate role here).
  - MAYBE: Janetta Sheringham (voice comparison).
  - MAYBE: John (from pastoral memory; not necessarily the same as “May’s” companion).
- **Time markers:**
  - MAYBE: none explicit; conversation pause suggests contemporaneous overhearing.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Will/inheritance: “leave everything to me”.
  - Spilled wine + “fragments of… flesh” (disturbing physical aftermath).
  - Pastoral nostalgia: hay field; buttered rolls; straw games; cricket-as-war-horse imagery.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Eavesdropping, then retreat (“none of my business”); memory-driven associative leaps.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: paired with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md (documents/will framing + poet quote).
  - MAYBE: Henry-appears-as-assistant cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md (Henry dealing with bodies/cleanup).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “May” later appears in a clearly different social circle/time than Page 12’s documents scene.
- **Research needed:**
  - None (Janetta Sheringham not yet identifiable in external sources; keep tracking for recurrence).
