In my youth I had been worried that I bore the same name as Newbolt’s admiral and Shakespeare’s sergeant, and it had irked me when, in my student days, I had been known as the Smiler with the Knife. Afterwards I found it better in practice to capitalise my third letter. The Blue Rocket was still going down next day ; in fact, I knew too much to let it go up. It even seemed to be succeeding. The snowy-banded, dilettante, delicate-handed? At least I was the last. I would not say at last I was the least. I tried to interest him in my little Black Museum, and indeed elicited a frisson with the preserved eyeball of the well-known and respected Cadaver Charlie. The eye in which, just before its fellow was shot out by the Chicago sleuth, he had asked that suave detective if he, the detective, could see any green. It looked, though, as if Henry had been playing about with this exhibit. I would have to take steps.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”; name clue points to DEATH / De’Ath).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; appears to have “been playing about” with an exhibit).
  - CERTAIN: “him” (unnamed listener/guest shown the narrator’s Black Museum).
  - CERTAIN: “Cadaver Charlie” (macabre exhibit/figure).
  - MAYBE: “Chicago sleuth” (unnamed detective in the Cadaver Charlie anecdote).
  - CERTAIN: Newbolt’s “Admiral Death” + Shakespeare’s “fell Sergeant death” (Hamlet V.2) → name = DEATH (Newbolt: Page:Poems,_new_and_old_(IA_poemsnewold00newb).pdf/68; Shakespeare: Page:Shakespeare_-_First_Folio_Faithfully_Reproduced,_Methuen,_1910.djvu/797).
  - LIKELY: “The Blue Rocket” = aconite (blue rocket / wolfsbane / monkshood; EB1911 “Poison”, Page:EB1911_-_Volume_21.djvu/928).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “next day”.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Detective-crime collection: “Black Museum” + preserved body part.
  - “Green” detail embedded in the eyeball story (possible clue-word recurrence).
  - CERTAIN: “Smiler with the Knife” is Chaucer’s phrase in *The Knight’s Tale* (Temple of Mars description): “the smiler with the knife under the mantle” (Page:The_Canterbury_tales_of_Geoffrey_Chaucer.djvu/67).
  - Name-play: “capitalise my third letter” (identity-cipher style).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-mythologising criminal/detective register (“Smiler with the Knife”; “Black Museum”).
  - Threat of intervention (“I would have to take steps”) toward Henry.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: belongs with the detective/self-fashioning cluster (crime-museum + sleuth allusions).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Black Museum” and Cadaver Charlie are purely figurative or offhand jokes with no recurrence.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the Cadaver Charlie / Chicago sleuth / “see any green” anecdote.
