As I was not staying, but only passing through, I raised my hat to the eleven that played All England for a thousand guineas, and beat them twenty-nine times in ten years. I paid respect also to a couple of exceptionally large yets. After all, I was doing another man’s work for him. As I progressed, I began to remember what my favourite author had called him. He had called him lovely and soothing, and delicate. He had called him cool-enfolding and a dark mother. From me to thee, he had said, glad serenades, dances for thee I propose saluting thee. Also vast and well-veil’d. But somehow I had my doubts. I sat on the grass, and counted a distinct ninety between each beat of my heart. I would have to go slow. Each beat, I saw, puffed out of my breast like purple smoke from an exhaust. I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers. The echoes ring with our indecent calls, I pick out some low person for my dearest friend.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - LIKELY: Hambledon/Hampshire cricket side as “the eleven that played All England for a thousand guineas” — *Annals of Cricket* (1896) records a match “between the Duke of Dorset, with the **Hampshire men**, against **all England**” for **1000 guineas**: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QV0ElltRphYC&pg=PA36; and *Baily’s Magazine of Sports & Pastimes* (1925) notes the **Hambledon Cricket Club** “beat… All England… **twenty-nine times in ten years**” (citing Nyren’s “Young Cricketer’s Guide”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=twgbAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA226.
  - MAYBE: narrator’s “favourite author” = Whitman (strongly implied by quotations).
- **Places:**
  - LIKELY: Hambledon / Hampshire (implied by the cricket reference).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Physical state: counting “ninety” between heartbeats; resolves to “go slow”.
  - Movement/travel: “not staying… passing through”.
  - Dialect: “yett(s)” = (Scot.) gate/door (Chambers 1908): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Y_Y-wis.
  - Modernity image: heartbeat “purple smoke from an exhaust”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: multiple Walt Whitman lines (e.g., “I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers…”).
  - MAYBE: “lovely and soothing… cool-enfolding… a dark mother… vast and well-veil’d” (Whitman description of an unnamed “him”; likely a personified thing such as sea/night).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Whitman-heavy quotation density; bodily self-monitoring.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: clusters with other Whitman-quoting page(s) (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the Whitman snippets are shown to be coincidental and the surrounding narrative voice differs strongly from Page 32.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify what Whitman text is being blended here and what the described “him” refers to.
