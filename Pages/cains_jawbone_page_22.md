He always talked to me about murder, when we were alone together. And that day he told me it was the birthday of a good one in prison. John and Cornelius, the Dort people ; I can’t say I understood very much. But I liked his name, and showed him so, for he had always been very clement to me, even about that cat Jasmine. By the bye, Tusitala and Flora had both come over to our place. Of course you might say that was nothing to make a song about. But others had not agreed. And just as I was feeling how much I loved him, he put on funny clothes and went away. I lowered myself and made love to Flora. It was quite late when he came back with her. He had always told me that I was absurdly sensitive. It might be so. Explain it how you will, when I first set eyes on her I felt no vibration, no hint at all, of my latter end. I was banished and slept miserably with Flora.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: “he” (talks about murder; wears “funny clothes”; returns with Flora).
  - CERTAIN: John and Cornelius “the Dort people” = Johan (John) de Witt + Cornelius de Witt (Dutch statesmen; born at Dort/Dordrecht). (EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/De_Witt,_John ; https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/De_Witt,_Cornelius)
  - CERTAIN: Jasmine (a cat).
  - CERTAIN: Tusitala (name; could be Stevenson allusion or a pet with that name).
  - CERTAIN: Flora (object of narrator’s mating/banishment story).
- **Time markers:**
  - LIKELY: “birthday of a good one in prison” points to Cornelius de Witt (the brother actually confined in the Gevangenpoort); Cornelius’s birthdate is given as 15 June 1623 (Parieu, *John de Witt; or, twenty years’ interregnum…* 1858, Google Books: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PnlZAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA7). EB1911 records John de Witt’s birthdate (24 Sept 1625) but he is not the imprisoned brother. (EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/De_Witt,_John)
  - CERTAIN: “quite late when he came back…”
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Animal-coded narration: “lowered myself” / tail “vibration” absent → likely dog POV.
  - Jealousy/banishment; house dynamics; murder-talk fixation.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Strong dog POV (tail-vibration cue, mating behaviour, “slept” banished).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: dog‑narrator cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md (animal reactions/ears/low noise).
  - MAYBE: jasmine motif echo with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md (wild jasmine).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later pages show human POV here (tail “vibration” is a metaphor) or Flora/Jasmine are people.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) John/Cornelius “Dort people” = De Witt brothers; date likely points to John de Witt’s birthday (24 Sept).
  - Clarify whether Tusitala is an allusion (Stevenson) or a named pet/visitor.
