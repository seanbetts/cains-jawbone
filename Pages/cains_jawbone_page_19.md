Yesterday he got in another of his own kind, who agreed she’d done it all herself. He twiddled the polished knob and Mr. Hall came into the room again. I heard him muttering that it was appropriate the Human Comedy couldn’t possibly have gone on beyond to-day. I, rather surprisingly, liked music. Surprisingly, that is, to anyone who did not know that my people came from the same place as the McCrimmons, that famous race of hereditary music makers. I was rather astonished to hear him saying something about someone who was by virtue first, then choice, a queen. Tell me, if she were not design’d th’ eclipse and glory of her kind. So I pulled his sleeve. He pulled my ears, and said it was Wotton, which I didn’t think it was, and that she had only just come to Falkland. I made a low noise and at once knew I had done the wrong thing. Usually he just said William Sydney Porter, which I offended ; but then he said something much worse.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Mr. Hall (reappears; likely a servant responding to a call-bell/bell-push).
  - CERTAIN: McCrimmons (hereditary music-makers; Skye association).
  - MAYBE: “he” (handler/owner; pulls narrator’s ears; sleeve pulled).
  - LIKELY: “she” = Elizabeth Stuart (Queen of Bohemia) (per Wotton quotation + “Falkland” birthplace hint).
  - CERTAIN: William Sydney Porter (O. Henry) (reference).
  - MAYBE: Wotton (attribution disputed by narrator).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “Yesterday…”
  - LIKELY: “to-day” is a historical-death anchor; “Human Comedy couldn’t… beyond to-day” suggests Balzac’s death date (ties to Page 8’s Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”).
  - MAYBE: “only just come to Falkland” points to Falkland Castle (Fife) and Elizabeth Stuart’s birth there (19 Aug 1596 per DNB), but conflicts with the Balzac Aug 18 “to-day” anchor; treat as an identification clue unless another page makes Aug 19 explicit.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - LIKELY: “Human Comedy” = Balzac.
  - CERTAIN: Sir Henry Wotton, “You meaner Beauties of the Night” (“On his Mistris, the Queen of Bohemia”) — “By Vertue first, then Choyce a Queen… Tell me… Th’ Eclypse and Glory of her kind” (text reproduced in E. R. Eddison, *The Worm Ouroboros* (1922), ch. 30): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Worm_Ouroboros/Chapter_30.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Polished knob / repeated Mr. Hall entrances: LIKELY a call-bell/bell-push being rung to summon him.
  - Animal-coded behaviour: ear pulling; “low noise” reaction.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Outsider/naïve social position (ears pulled); unexpected love of music with “my people” origin clue.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md (p8 ends with the knob being twiddled and Mr. Hall bursting in; here Mr. Hall “came into the room again” after the polished knob is twiddled).
  - MAYBE: “Yesterday” aligns with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md’s Aug 17 “closing day in Potsdam” if this is part of a consecutive mid‑August daybook run.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later pages show two different “Mr. Hall” contexts or incompatible settings.
- **Research needed:**
  - Resolved: Wotton “You meaner Beauties of the Night” (Queen of Bohemia/Elizabeth Stuart) + Falkland Castle birthplace hint (see Indexes/quotes.md and Indexes/places.md).
  - Resolved: the knob is a call-bell/bell-push; Mr. Hall is the summoned servant (see Indexes/research_queue.md).
