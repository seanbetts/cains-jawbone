All the artist in me flared up. After all, my given name was world-famous as the inherited one of a bold, subtle and delightful painter. I was, perhaps, unreasonably proud of that ; took a sort of proprietary interest in “The Mumpers.” Why not? It would have been absurd to concern myself with Hamlet’s one, a thing of dreams only, or to have let my spirit flutter around Runymede. But that was far away, and instead was a quiet country town, gabled and venerable, unmodernised and unambitious, with a river, a Tudor ruin, a park of deer, heather commons and, on the E. V. Lucas a non Lucendo principle, immense woods. O the orator’s joys! O trieste, trieste etait mon ame, to inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from the ribs and throat a cause, a cause d’une femme. I rather relished my sandwich. But food and drink were so bad for the stuff. I remembered the place of my initiation behind the old Port at Marseille, the furtive plush, the little airless secret rooms hung round with

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator claims a “given name” shared with a famous painter’s inherited name (identity clue; painter/source TBD).
- **Places:**
  - MAYBE: described “quiet country town” (river + Tudor ruin + deer park + heather commons + immense woods; identity TBD).
  - CERTAIN: Runymede (allusion).
  - CERTAIN: Marseille (old Port; “place of my initiation” behind it).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “O tristesse, tristesse était mon âme” (French quotation; source TBD).
  - CERTAIN: E. V. Lucas / “lucus a non lucendo” punning reference.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Oratory/voice: “orator’s joys… roll the thunder… a cause d’une femme”.
  - Appetite vs performance: sandwich enjoyed but “bad for the stuff”.
  - Initiation in “secret rooms” behind a port (continues into next page).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Performative and educated; toggles between art-identity, rhetoric, and sensual memory.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: continues directly into Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md (“hung round with photographs…”), implying adjacency `73 → 74`.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - Only if later evidence shows an editorial/transcription artifact (unlikely).
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the painter whose surname matches the narrator’s given name (and why “The Mumpers” matters).
  - Identify the “quiet country town” described here.
  - Identify the “O tristesse…” quotation source.
