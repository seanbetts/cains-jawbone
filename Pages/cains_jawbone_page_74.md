photographs of young and laughing athletes, lads who had profited and gone on, and ringing with those words of the Head, as we called him, that one by one the touch of life has turned to truth. But again I was distracted. “Will anyone know about them?” that husky miracle of a voice was asking, and I thought, not for the first time, that it would have caresses for all, a golden impartiality. To love her would be a liberal, no, a communist education. The red rose and the white only remained, and these were melting and blurring before my eyes ; my wretched eyes that could not tell me the truth, for instance, about that Goya reproduction. A hanging man? A countess? “There is no danger of that,” the old man said, “I bought them secretly in Leningrad from a little humpbacked fellow, a double-faced Quasimodo of the Ogpu.” This was difficult enough to reconcile with his Manchester speech on sane mediocrity. “From the secret police?” The words rang like tense half-crowns dropped upon marble. “Goodness gracious!” “But it so seldom is,” came the wise old reply.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “the Head” (quoted voice from narrator’s past; likely the same “Head” figure seen elsewhere; confirm).
  - CERTAIN: “that husky… voice” / “her” (unnamed woman).
  - CERTAIN: “the old man” (unnamed; claims secret purchases in Leningrad; gives “wise old reply”).
  - CERTAIN: “little humpbacked fellow” (unnamed seller; “double-faced Quasimodo of the Ogpu”).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Leningrad (source of the secret purchases).
  - CERTAIN: Manchester (referenced via “speech on sane mediocrity”).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “one by one the touch of Life has turned to truth” — Sir Henry Newbolt, “Clifton Chapel” (in *Poems: New and Old*): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems:_New_and_Old_(Newbolt)/Clifton_Chapel
  - CERTAIN: OGPU (Soviet secret police; period anchor).
  - CERTAIN: Goya reproduction (identity unclear; narrator can’t visually resolve it).
  - LIKELY: “a countess” = Goya’s **Countess of Chinchón** portrait(s); “a hanging man” = a hanging-scene print (e.g., *Los Desastres de la Guerra* captions). Both are listed in Albert F. Calvert, *Goya, an account of his life and works* (Gutenberg #64514): https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/64514/pg64514.txt
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Secrecy/blackmail risk: “Will anyone know about them?” / “no danger… bought them secretly”.
  - Eyes/vision failure: can’t tell “A hanging man? A countess?”
  - Red rose + white remaining (echoes earlier colour/flower triads).
  - LIKELY: “them” = the plural items bought secretly in Leningrad (photographs/prints/reproductions and/or documents), with the Goya reproduction likely one of the set.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Sensual + political; charged metaphors (“tense half-crowns… on marble”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md (direct continuation).
  - LIKELY: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md (red+white flowers remain → “two other flowers” + marigolds; “them” bought secretly → “orange tinted documents”; eyesight failure persists).
  - MAYBE: links to the “Head”/school-colours cluster (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md–Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md) (treat as overlap-only unless a second school-specific anchor appears).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Head” here is a different figure than the earlier headmaster, or if the “them” are not documents/objects that recur.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify which specific Goya hanging-scene print is meant (if a clearer description recurs); the countess side most plausibly points to the Countess of Chinchón.
