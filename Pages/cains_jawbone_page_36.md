Strange that old Calabar, as I called him, should fail me ; yet on the morning after I had introduced him to the person most concerned, I felt certain that I could not rely on him. I would give him another day, and then. . . . It was distinctly awkward in a way. At eleven in the forenoon little Mavis Kitchener came with a gift of eggs, a clutch of eggs, I might say, looking at her determined little fists. Distinctly awkward : for, knowing they were bound to be bad, I spent an hour I could ill afford in finding her an equivalent in wormy raspberries. How could I marry her in the circumstances? Your good uncle, whom you count the father of your fortune, longed for this alliance. I remembered, as I wandered among the abortive Bengal attempts of the rhododendrons, that she whose bidding I then did would always make up. Henry was always made up too. He had buried the corpse ; only the eyes showed.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Calabar (likely Calabar bean/physostigma; “old Calabar”).
  - CERTAIN: Mavis Kitchener.
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - MAYBE: “good uncle… father of your fortune” (quotation; not necessarily an in-world uncle).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “morning after”; “at eleven in the forenoon”.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Poison failure: Calabar “should fail me”; “give him another day”.
  - Food exchange: bad eggs ↔ wormy raspberries.
  - Horticulture: rhododendrons (“abortive Bengal attempts”).
  - Make-up: “Henry was always made up too.”
  - Burial detail: buried corpse with only the eyes showing.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Practical poison-garden logistics mixed with social marriage pressure.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md (“morning after I had introduced him…”).
  - LIKELY: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md (Calabar/physostigma “fail[ure]” → later “discarded… physostigma”).
  - MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md (unique “awkward” phrasing + poison-failure beats; p59 adds police attention).
  - LIKELY: strengthens plant/poison thread (Calabar/physostigma) and Henry-as-killer thread.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Calabar” and corpse-burial are later shown to be figurative/embedded narrative.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) “Your good uncle, whom you count the father of your fortune, [longs/longed] for this alliance” is from Alfred, Lord Tennyson, “The Sisters” (tense-shifted in *Cain’s Jawbone*): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O539WMK95hsC&pg=PA461&dq=%22father%20of%20your%20fortune%22
  - (Resolved) “old Calabar” fits Calabar bean (*Physostigma venenosum*), the “ordeal bean” of Old Calabar; EB1911 notes the poisonous dose may be rejected by the stomach (relevant to “should fail me”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Calabar_Bean
  - Is Mavis Kitchener an allusive name (Kitchener) or an in-world character?
