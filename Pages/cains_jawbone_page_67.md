the darker works of Beardsley and Felicien Rops, and ringing with the gloat curses of the Head, as we called him, lubriciously gasping in the grip of ether. I took the first blink of the light at the place of the Whympers. Mrs. Allingham painted the fishshop, I remembered, and the author of the Land of Mist played cricket for it till he went up the hill. I too had been struck from the float for ever held in solution, I too had received identity by my body, that I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I should be of my body. That was a pretty important day, for old Chris left Palos on it ; and you all know by this time the result of that. But upon my soul I wasn’t sure how to celebrate, though celebration was one of my specialties. Ought I to allow myself another ration of my herb of grace, and sheerly rejoice, or should I merely weep? Helen and crooning? Poe and Prohibition? Canvas-backed clams and the prejudicial Menkin? The balance was too hard to strike. In the end I carried on as usual.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Aubrey Beardsley (art reference).
  - CERTAIN: Félicien Rops (art reference).
  - CERTAIN: “the Head” (headmaster; “gloat curses”; “grip of ether”).
  - MAYBE: “place of the Whympers” (birthplace clue; needs ID).
  - CERTAIN: Mrs. Allingham (likely Helen Allingham; fishshop painting reference).
  - CERTAIN: author of *The Land of Mist* (Conan Doyle; cricket reference).
  - CERTAIN: “old Chris” (Christopher Columbus).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “old Chris left Palos” → 3 Aug 1492 (strong calendar anchor for “that… day”; likely narrator birthday).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “herb of grace” (rue; Hamlet/Ophelia phrase; confirm intent).
  - MAYBE: “Helen and crooning? Poe and Prohibition? … Menkin?” (dense allusive menu of celebration options; sources TBD).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Birth/embodiment meditation (“received identity by my body…”).
  - Celebration vs mourning; possible intoxicant/ritual (“ration” of herb of grace).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Highly allusive, punning, self-aware about “celebration” as a specialty.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md (direct sentence continuation).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Palos”/Columbus is shown to be metaphorical rather than a date anchor (still likely a calendar pointer).
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify “place of the Whympers” + fishshop painting and which “it” Conan Doyle played cricket for.
  - Identify “herb of grace” usage in this context and the “Helen/Poe/Menkin” references.
