        And pipes for closets all over, and cutting the frames
                too light,
        But M’Cullough he died in the sixties, and---well,
                I’m dying to-night. . . . 


Had not the author of Wails of a Tayside Inn said of them that they were the living poems and that all the rest were dead? Had not the winger of Wimpole Street said that they were binding up their hearts away from breaking with a cerement of the grave? Anyway their hour had come and was now over ; just but emphatically over, and I could not be sorry. I knew, after arguing it out from one side of my aching head to another---those little Bunny and Perry, Pro and Con, had been at it hammer and tongs on the centre court between the two lobes of my brain---that if I had no tangible proof against the erstwhile cleanser of my old headgear, I had merely a thistledown of semi-conviction against the other. That his thought process, when I tapped its wire, had been calling her a Cambridge week, helped me, surely, not at all.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - MAYBE: two suspects/targets (one is an “erstwhile cleanser of my old headgear”; “the other” is a second person).
  - MAYBE: “her” (someone the “other” calls “a Cambridge week”).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - MAYBE (quoted): “I’m dying to-night” appears in the opening stanza; unclear if purely quoted vs in-world.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: quoted stanza is Kipling, “The Mary Gloster” (*The Seven Seas*, 1896): “And pipes for closets all over… But M’Cullough he died in the Sixties, and Well, I’m dying to-night …” (Page:The_Seven_Seas_(Kipling,_1896).djvu/168).
  - CERTAIN: “Wails of a Tayside Inn” is a title-pun pointing to Longfellow (author of *Tales of a Wayside Inn*); the “living poems… all the rest were dead” line is from Longfellow’s “Children” (Birds of Passage): “For ye are living poems, / And all the rest are dead.” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Birds_of_Passage_(Collection)/Children)
  - CERTAIN: “winger of Wimpole Street” points to Elizabeth Barrett Browning; the line is from “The Cry of the Children”: “They are binding up their hearts away from breaking, / With a cerement from the grave.” (Page:Poems_Barrett.djvu/241).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Evidence/conviction language (“tangible proof”; “semi-conviction”).
  - Surveillance register (“tapped its wire”).
  - Naming/wordplay: “Cambridge week” (MAYBE “May Week”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Formal reasoning dramatised as internal tennis match (“Bunny and Perry, Pro and Con”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md (p97’s on-the-day “never done before” setup + Cambridge wordplay layer; this page reads like a later weighing of “tangible proof” vs “semi-conviction”; see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N07` Sequence A).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “hat-cleaner” and “other” resolve as purely metaphorical (not actual suspects).
- **Research needed:**
  - Interpret “Cambridge week” and whether it points to a person named May.
