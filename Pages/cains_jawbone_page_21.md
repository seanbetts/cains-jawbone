To reckon with Henry! That was never easy. Just beyond the laurels, I turned sharply and there he was, bending over the body of his latest victim. There was blood all about. I called to him sharply and he seemed dazed. Afterwards I brought in my rough old friend Calabar Bean to help me---this on the very day when I had proved digitalis purpurea, though I did not know if the profession prescribe it usually as such, a signal wash out. But why should this aspect have come into my head? Far, far from here the Adriatic breaks in a warm bay among the green Illyrian hills. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Read Mark Twain and inwardly digest. But I had to keep my wits about me. He pottered about with me and succeeded at last in making friends with Henry. Already he felt that I was leading him to the fountain Ponce de Leon sought, where he who drinks is deathless. And he was not so far wrong.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry (caught “bending over the body of his latest victim”).
  - CERTAIN: Calabar Bean = *Physostigma venenosum* seed (“ordeal bean” of Old Calabar); source of physostigmine (eserine); poisonous. (EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Calabar_Bean)
  - CERTAIN: digitalis purpurea (foxglove/digitalis leaves; cardiac drug, cumulative poison; also described as a “powerful diuretic” in small/moderate doses → likely “signal wash out”). (EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Digitalis)
  - CERTAIN: Ponce de Leon (Fountain of Youth allusion).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “on the very day” narrator “proved digitalis purpurea”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “Far, far from here the Adriatic breaks…” (source TBD).
  - Wordplay: “Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Read Mark Twain…”
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Poisons/heart agents: digitalis + calabar bean.
  - Blood/victim language around Henry.
  - Immortality/fountain-of-youth framing (“deathless”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Botanical/pharmacological diction; clinical aside about “the profession prescribe it”.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: poison/gardening thread with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md (foxgloves/digitalis) and other pill/substance pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md).
  - MAYBE: Henry-as-killer thread (compare Henry scenes on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “victim” is later clearly metaphorical (surgical patient, etc.) rather than murder.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) EB1911 describes digitalis as a “powerful diuretic” in small/moderate doses → “signal wash out” likely diuresis/flush.
  - Identify the Adriatic/Illyrian line source.
