To have slept and to wake right up surrounded by an atmosphere in which Bunny and Perry went at it hammer and tongs, seemed almost sacrilege. That was the day when I was going to do a thing I had never done before. I looked at Henry, and felt a little sick. I took two pills. I had too soon---perhaps I did not want to go even so quickly as my ordered slowness---exchanged a tennis venue for a rowing one. I was not in Dorset ; but I murmured to myself that Ellen Brine of Allenburn would never mwore return. The connection was obvious. What a day, I thought, for the despatch of Paris and Leonidas. Cambridge or Thermopylae? But Paris? I had never at school looked upon him as in any sort a healer. I had, infact, never heard of John Ayrton then. Oeuvre ton ame et ton oreille au son de ma mandoline : pour toi j’ai fait, pour toi, cette chanson cruelle et caline. But I wasn’t thinking of John Ayrton.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; narrator looks at him before “a thing I had never done before”).
  - CERTAIN: Bunny and Perry (recur as Pro/Con mental combatants).
  - LIKELY: Paris and Leonidas (allusive targets: Dr John Ayrton Paris; Spartan King Leonidas).
  - MAYBE: John Ayrton (named; narrator says he wasn’t thinking of him).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “That was the day” (event day framing).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - MAYBE: “a thing I had never done before” + nausea + taking two pills (could be self-drugging before an act).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Pills: “I took two pills.”
  - Tennis → rowing venue shift (scene transition marker).
  - Repeats the “Bunny and Perry… hammer and tongs” phrasing also used in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Ellen Brine ov Allenburn / Would never mwore return” — William Barnes, “Ellen Brine ov Allenburn” (*Poems of Rural Life in the Dorset Dialect*, 1879), Page:Barnes_(1879)_Poems_of_rural_life_in_the_Dorset_dialect_(combined).djvu/219.
  - CERTAIN: French lyric is Paul Verlaine, “Sérénade” (*Poèmes saturniens*, 1866): “Ouvre ton âme… De ma mandoline… Cruelle et câline.” (Page:Verlaine_-_Poèmes_saturniens,_Lemerre,_1866.djvu/112); CJ spells “Oeuvre” for “Ouvre”.
  - CERTAIN: “Paris” is a pun on Dr John Ayrton Paris (a “healer”), who “graduated M.B. at Cambridge in 1808” (DNB): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Paris,_John_Ayrton.
  - CERTAIN: Leonidas is the Spartan king associated with Thermopylae (EB1911): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Leonidas.
  - LIKELY: “Cambridge or Thermopylae?” contrasts Dr Paris (Cambridge) with Leonidas (Thermopylae).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: clusters with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md via the distinctive Bunny-and-Perry phrasing.
  - MAYBE: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md (this page frames the “never done before” day setup + Cambridge wordplay; p93 reads like later evidence-weighing; see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N07` Sequence A).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Bunny and Perry” is shown to be a generic metaphor independently reused by multiple narrators.
- **Research needed:**
  - (none)
