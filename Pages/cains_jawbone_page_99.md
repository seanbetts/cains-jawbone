And she wore a mauve love-knot on her breast, and the ends were unequal. He said he’d put that right, but he couldn't find the silly old jossers, as Jasmine might so easily have called them. I was old enough to remember her ; she wasn’t the one I’d killed. He had read out about some most excellent potent brilliant eyes, swift-darting as the stars, steadfast as the sun ; grey, we said, of the azure-grey colour ; large enough, not of glaring size ; the habitual expression of them vigilance and penetrating sense, rapidity resting on depth. When she asked him why he had chosen those and whose they were, he answered : Father Fred’s, and because it was closing day in Potsdam. I had had a dry shampoo that morning, a thing I adored, especially on the old chest. Rather a waste of time, though, as it turned out. Of course I ought to have been more careful of such a trifle. Suddenly I felt that I had put my foot in it. Still I had three more left.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - CERTAIN: “she” (mauve love-knot; asks questions).
  - CERTAIN: “he” (tries to adjust the love-knot; reads out an eye-description passage).
  - CERTAIN: Father Fred (named; LIKELY Friedrich/Frederick the Great; see Quotes & allusions).
  - MAYBE: Jasmine (LIKELY the cat from Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md; narrator “remembers her” and distinguishes her from the one he killed).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator admits a prior killing (“she wasn’t the one I’d killed”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Bow/love-knot ends unequal + attempted trimming mirrors earlier bow/left-end trimming language (compare Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md).
  - Jasmine/cat thread: compare Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md (“that cat Jasmine”) and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md (“matter of Jasmine”).
  - “Put my foot in it… Still I had three more left” suggests a non-human POV (four-footed) or heavy idiom/wordplay.
  - Grooming: “dry shampoo… on the old chest” (voice/POV tell).
  - “Closing day in Potsdam” (date/place anchor candidate).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Potsdam (as a “closing day” reference; LIKELY Frederick the Great’s death at Sanssouci, Potsdam).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: the “most excellent… brilliant eyes… azure-grey… rapidity resting on depth” description is Carlyle on Friedrich (quoted via James Thomson): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Biographical_and_critical_studies_by_James_Thomson_(%22B.V.%22)/%22The_Ring_and_the_Book%22.
  - CERTAIN: “closing day in Potsdam” points to Frederick II’s death at Sanssouci (Potsdam) on 17 Aug 1786 (EB1911): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Frederick_II._of_Prussia.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md (this page has the bow ends unequal + missing “jossers”; Page 8 reads like a later repetition of the same bow moment where “that time he found them and trimmed the left end”).
  - MAYBE: part of a consecutive mid‑August daybook run (Aug 17 anchor) following Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md (Aug 16 “Hyacinth’s day”) and leading into Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md / Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md (Aug 18 anchors). Weak support beyond dates: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md shares the object-naming aside structure (“…, as … called them”) and dog-idiom framing.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “killed” refers to an animal kill or metaphor rather than one of the in-world murders.
- **Research needed:**
  - Determine whether the four-foot/“three more left” wording signals animal POV continuity.
