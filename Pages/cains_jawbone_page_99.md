And she wore a mauve love-knot on her breast, and the ends were unequal. He said he’d put that right, but he couldn't find the silly old jossers, as Jasmine might so easily have called them. I was old enough to remember her ; she wasn’t the one I’d killed. He had read out about some most excellent potent brilliant eyes, swift-darting as the stars, steadfast as the sun ; grey, we said, of the azure-grey colour ; large enough, not of glaring size ; the habitual expression of them vigilance and penetrating sense, rapidity resting on depth. When she asked him why he had chosen those and whose they were, he answered : Father Fred’s, and because it was closing day in Potsdam. I had had a dry shampoo that morning, a thing I adored, especially on the old chest. Rather a waste of time, though, as it turned out. Of course I ought to have been more careful of such a trifle. Suddenly I felt that I had put my foot in it. Still I had three more left.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - CERTAIN: “she” (mauve love-knot; asks questions).
  - CERTAIN: “he” (tries to adjust the love-knot; reads out an eye-description passage).
  - CERTAIN: Father Fred (named; “excellent… eyes” are said to be his).
  - MAYBE: Jasmine (referenced as someone who would call old men “jossers”).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator admits a prior killing (“she wasn’t the one I’d killed”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Bow/love-knot ends unequal + attempted trimming mirrors earlier bow/left-end trimming language (compare Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md).
  - “Put my foot in it… Still I had three more left” suggests a non-human POV (four-footed) or heavy idiom/wordplay.
  - Grooming: “dry shampoo… on the old chest” (voice/POV tell).
  - “Closing day in Potsdam” (date/place anchor candidate).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Potsdam (as a “closing day” reference; likely allusive).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “killed” refers to an animal kill or metaphor rather than one of the in-world murders.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the quoted eye-description passage and why it’s tied to “Father Fred”.
  - Identify what “closing day in Potsdam” refers to (date/event clue).
  - Determine whether the four-foot/“three more left” wording signals animal POV continuity.
