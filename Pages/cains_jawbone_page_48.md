I had always thought that Tate essentially meant sugar. This I liked almost next to anything, though mostly not at once, but under the gas fire and pulled out when there was nobody else. But he said to her, as in the game a lot of them played there once, another had begun to-day, and had wormed his way into the Book of Common Prayer. But I didn’t think he would tast so good ; I preferred the sugar one. I thought they were together too much. I became convinced that I must be a sad dog ; I tried to remember all the times when one of the other sex had preoccupied me, and we had been oblivious of all else. I tried to forgive. He called her Crataegus Oxyacantha over the cocktails ; that was his big joke. I knew it by the way he laughed, and I too rolled about. But I liked the real way to call her best. I met Ecky that evening, he was very happy ; but just about all in. When I greeted him he nearly fell on my nose.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Ecky (met “that evening”).
  - CERTAIN: “Tate” = sugar brand (Henry Tate made “Tate’s Cube Sugar” famous; *Encyclopaedia Britannica* 1911, “TATE, SIR HENRY”, Page:EB1911_-_Volume_26.djvu/478).
  - MAYBE: unnamed “he” and “her” (a couple; narrator thinks they are together too much).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day”; “that evening”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - “wormed his way into the Book of Common Prayer” (context unclear; likely a specific phrase/event clue).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Sugar hoarding: kept under the gas fire and pulled out secretly.
  - Dog-coded self-description: “sad dog”; greeted Ecky who nearly fell on narrator’s nose.
  - Cocktails + botanical joke-name: “Crataegus Oxyacantha”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Strong animal/dog POV candidate (nose/body perspective); comic literalism.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: animal POV cluster.
  - MAYBE: links to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md via Ecky/Alexander recurrence.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If later context makes the “nose” and “sad dog” language purely idiomatic (human narrator).
- **Research needed:**
  - Interpret the Book of Common Prayer + “wormed his way” clue.
  - Why “Crataegus Oxyacantha” is “his big joke” (does it encode a name like “May”?).
