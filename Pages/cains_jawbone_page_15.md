Now, I considered, in my dear Lyons it would be coming of age hours, and I wondered if they would ever do that over here. I fancied what self-consciousness and preciosity there would be, for instance, if the B.B.C. ever took it up. A strange institution ; but the nursed fuse was always interesting. Yes, if sitting at the familiar table with Bart chewing at my moccasins, I could have broadcast it all, I would have left the mighty heart of England to deal with it. On that very day, I recalled, another terrible thing happened. John Hewit and Sarah Drew, just engaged to be married, were working together in a field of barley when they were both struck by lightning. Alexander, the only noteworthy Pope of my native land, was demonstrably affected. And my namesake wrote a letter, in which he said that Sarah’s left eye was injured, and there appeared a black spot on her breast. Her lover was all over black ; but not the least sign of life was found in either.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: “Lyons” (place vs Lyons tea-shop/Corner House; narrator’s “dear Lyons”).
  - MAYBE: Bart (likely a dog; “chewing… moccasins”).
  - CERTAIN: B.B.C. (reference).
  - CERTAIN: John Hewit; Sarah Drew (killed by lightning; Steeple Ashton; last day of July 1718).
  - CERTAIN: Alexander Pope (poet; wrote an epitaph for Hewit/Drew, showing he was “affected”).
  - CERTAIN: John Gay (wrote a letter describing the injuries from the lightning deaths; likely the “namesake”).
  - MAYBE: narrator shares a name with John Gay (“my namesake”).
- **Time markers:**
  - MAYBE: “coming of age hours” (time-of-day phrasing; unclear).
  - CERTAIN: “On that very day…” introduces a date-anchored anecdote: last day of July 1718 (July 31).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Broadcasting/England: urge to “broadcast it all” and let “England” deal with it.
  - Lightning death details (injury descriptions); letters + epitaph as evidence.
  - Domestic scene marker: dog chewing footwear.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Reflective, civic-minded (“mighty heart of England”); detail-heavy macabre reportage.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: calendar-anchor cluster with other “to-day” historical-death pages (e.g. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the John Hewit/Sarah Drew event cannot be tied to a specific date (or is fictionalised).
- **Research needed:**
  - Clarify what “Lyons” refers to here and what “coming of age hours” means.
