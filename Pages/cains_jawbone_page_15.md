Now, I considered, in my dear Lyons it would be coming of age hours, and I wondered if they would ever do that over here. I fancied what self-consciousness and preciosity there would be, for instance, if the B.B.C. ever took it up. A strange institution ; but the nursed fuse was always interesting. Yes, if sitting at the familiar table with Bart chewing at my moccasins, I could have broadcast it all, I would have left the mighty heart of England to deal with it. On that very day, I recalled, another terrible thing happened. John Hewit and Sarah Drew, just engaged to be married, were working together in a field of barley when they were both struck by lightning. Alexander, the only noteworthy Pope of my native land, was demonstrably affected. And my namesake wrote a letter, in which he said that Sarah’s left eye was injured, and there appeared a black spot on her breast. Her lover was all over black ; but not the least sign of life was found in either.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: Bart (likely a dog; “chewing… moccasins”).
  - CERTAIN: B.B.C. (reference).
  - CERTAIN: John Hewit; Sarah Drew (killed by lightning; Steeple Ashton; last day of July 1718).
  - CERTAIN: Alexander Pope (poet; wrote an epitaph for Hewit/Drew, showing he was “affected”).
  - CERTAIN: John Gay (wrote a letter describing the injuries from the lightning deaths; likely the “namesake”).
  - MAYBE: narrator shares a name with John Gay (“my namesake”).
- **Places:**
  - LIKELY: “Lyons” = Lyon (France) (English “Lyons”); EB1911: “LYONS (Fr. Lyon), a city of eastern France…” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Lyons
- **Time markers:**
  - LIKELY: “coming of age hours” = “twenty-one hours” (21:00; 24-hour clock pun: “coming of age” = 21).
  - CERTAIN: “On that very day…” introduces a date-anchored anecdote: last day of July 1718 (July 31).
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: double definition
- span: "coming of age hours"
- reading: "coming of age (21) -> twenty-one hours (21:00)"
- confidence: high
- rationale: “coming of age” commonly = 21; maps cleanly to 24-hour time.
- falsifier: If the surrounding context requires a literal coming-of-age ceremony/program rather than a clock pun.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): double definition
- span: "coming of age hours"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): coming of age (21) -> “twenty-one hours” (21:00; 24-hour clock), framed via “Lyons” (Lyon, France)"
- confidence: high
- why it matters: place -> supports “Lyons” as Lyon (France) and encodes a time-of-day marker.
- falsifiers:
  - “Lyons” is later clearly a J. Lyons & Co. venue in this narrator’s context (no time-zone contrast)
  - “coming of age hours” is used literally elsewhere (not as a 21→21:00 pun)
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Broadcasting/England: urge to “broadcast it all” and let “England” deal with it.
  - Lightning death details (injury descriptions); letters + epitaph as evidence.
  - Domestic scene marker: dog chewing footwear.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Reflective, civic-minded (“mighty heart of England”); detail-heavy macabre reportage.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: calendar-anchor cluster with other “to-day” historical-death pages (e.g. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md).
  - MAYBE: belongs to `N08` (King narrator) as an early table/dog/timekeeping vignette (Bart chewing moccasins + 21:00 clock pun); treat as a tentative lead-in to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md unless stronger voice anchors appear.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the John Hewit/Sarah Drew event cannot be tied to a specific date (or is fictionalised).
- **Research needed:**
  - None.
