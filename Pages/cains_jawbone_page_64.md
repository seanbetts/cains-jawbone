Needless to say I didn’t know that that was the last day. Afterwards I found it terrible to look back, and realise that I hadn’t made the most of it, or rather of all the little things that went to compose it, and the thousands that had gone before. I heard him read two things about a man and say that he had put in his appearance to-day. The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb, one was, in his gullet should have a hook. And the other called him a demure hypocrite or a blockhead. He must first torture his postman, the bait, and make him carry the letters of Bellerophon. But that was too big for me. My people had always owned allegiance to the McLeod of that ilk, among others. But until he told me about it to-day, I never knew that the Great Lexicographer had tasted Lotus with him. There was that in me which needed the exercise of fealty. To give all---as I had given all to him---was very bone of my bone.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “the Great Lexicographer” = Dr Samuel Johnson (*A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland*; “tasted lotus” at Dunvegan).
  - CERTAIN: McLeod of that ilk (clan-chief reference; Highland allegiance/fealty cue).
  - CERTAIN: “he” (unnamed; reads aloud; narrator’s loyalty target).
  - CERTAIN: Izaak Walton (the “man” being read about; angling quotations point to Walton-as-angler).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day” (the “man” has “put in his appearance to-day” — suggests calendar/Book-of-Days style framing).
  - CERTAIN: retrospective “I didn’t know that that was the last day” (last day of what/who is unclear).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “letters of Bellerophon” (fatal message carried unknowingly; used as bait/hook analogy).
  - MAYBE: “bone of my bone” (biblical phrasing; used for fealty).
  - CERTAIN: “The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb… in his gullet should have a hook.” (Byron, *Don Juan*, Canto XIII, stanza CVI; angling + Izaak Walton).
  - CERTAIN: “postman, the bait… letters of Bellerophon… demure hypocrite, or a blockhead.” (Horace Smith, *The Tin Trumpet* (1836), p. 35; “Angler” definition referencing Walton).
  - CERTAIN: “At Dunvegan I had tasted lotus…” (Samuel Johnson, *A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland*, Chapter 21; “Lotus” = forgetfulness/reluctance to depart).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Loyalty/fealty; inheritance of allegiance (“my people had always owned allegiance…”).
  - Angling/hook/bait metaphor for deceit/entrapment.
  - Great Lexicographer thread links strongly with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Reverential, clan/fealty language; heavy interleaving of learned allusion with personal devotion.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md (shared Great Lexicographer anchor + similar voice).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If McLeod/Lotus references point to a different lexicographer biography than Johnson’s.
- **Research needed:**
  - Clarify what “last day” refers to (death? separation? last visit?).
