        Rintrah, where has thou hid thy bride?
        Weeps she in desert shades?
        Alas! my Rintrah, bring the lovely jealous
           Ocalythron.


Then against a possible invasion of my privacy, I touched my white cheeks until they blushed. My luck was not in. He was a typically farm-labourer, with what thy’d call in Bloomsbury a Newdigate fringe. Just like that sort of a poet, I supposed they’d mean. He anchored himself heavily, consciously waving an empty pipe. Henry was now stooping over the other body, whistling between its teeth. What would I have done, I wondered? Really this sort of thing was native to me in a way. I wished there were water without going for it. I remembered, of course, that there was a conduit dating from 1597 standing here in the market place. But that was of little use to me. On the whole, I thought I would have as much nerve as my dear hero. But one never knew.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - LIKELY: farm-labourer (unnamed man; “Newdigate fringe” = poet/undergrad verse-prize stereotype: the “Newdigate” prize is for English verse at Oxford). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Newdigate,_Sir_Roger
  - CERTAIN: Henry (present; “stooping over the other body”).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Grantham (Lincolnshire) — EB1911 notes “A conduit dating from 1597 stands in the wide market-place.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Grantham
- **Time markers:**
  - MAYBE: implied immediacy (“now”; no explicit date).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: William Blake (“Rintrah… Ocalythron”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Bodies/corpses; discomfort about privacy; empty pipe.
  - Need for water vs fixed infrastructure (historic conduit).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-conscious, classed description (“Bloomsbury”); familiarity with grim scenes (“native to me”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md (p31 “reckon with Henry” + “two like these two” → p13’s two-body tableau with Henry “stooping over the other body”). Resolved check: p31’s “this very place” likely refers to this Grantham market place (conduit-1597 anchor).
  - MAYBE: Henry-handling-bodies cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md (Henry cleaning flesh/wine remnants).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Henry here is later clearly distinct from Henry elsewhere (different role/setting).
- **Research needed:**
  - None.
