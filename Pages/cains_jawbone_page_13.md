        Rintrah, where has thou hid thy bride?
        Weeps she in desert shades?
        Alas! my Rintrah, bring the lovely jealous
           Ocalythron.


Then against a possible invasion of my privacy, I touched my white cheeks until they blushed. My luck was not in. He was a typically farm-labourer, with what thy’d call in Bloomsbury a Newdigate fringe. Just like that sort of a poet, I supposed they’d mean. He anchored himself heavily, consciously waving an empty pipe. Henry was now stooping over the other body, whistling between its teeth. What would I have done, I wondered? Really this sort of thing was native to me in a way. I wished there were water without going for it. I remembered, of course, that there was a conduit dating from 1597 standing here in the market place. But that was of little use to me. On the whole, I thought I would have as much nerve as my dear hero. But one never knew.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: farm-labourer (unnamed man; “Newdigate fringe”).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (present; “stooping over the other body”).
  - MAYBE: market place conduit (dated 1597; implies specific town).
- **Time markers:**
  - MAYBE: implied immediacy (“now”; no explicit date).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: William Blake (“Rintrah… Ocalythron”).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Bodies/corpses; discomfort about privacy; empty pipe.
  - Need for water vs fixed infrastructure (historic conduit).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-conscious, classed description (“Bloomsbury”); familiarity with grim scenes (“native to me”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: Henry-handling-bodies cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md (Henry cleaning flesh/wine remnants).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Henry here is later clearly distinct from Henry elsewhere (different role/setting).
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify which market place has a conduit dated 1597 (place anchor).
  - What is meant by “Newdigate fringe” (hair/clue/reference)?
