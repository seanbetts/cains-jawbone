I considered that venerable whose winter Achilles thought to take from the lips of Cressida. Why not? I set fire to one end of him, gloatingly, and my nerves benefited. Electric Febrifuge may be ; but bad for life’s fitful fever. Its active ingredient had finally let me down. I was nothing if not generous. I started my fellow garden enthusiast on the foxgloves. He would appreciate that if he knew. Yes, I was doing my best for the dear girl. I wished I could make up (she would appreciate this) my mind about her. If we did decide---and that weighed with a girl---she would not have to change the initials on her parti-panties. I thought of the old spare-room in this very house, where Mrs. Gay used to lie upon her visits. When I was ill, I was put there, with the only dangling bell-wire in all the place, descending behind my head. I used of course to have nightmares of the Speckled Band, and awfully scream down the house.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Mrs. Gay (visited/stayed in spare-room “in this very house”).
  - MAYBE: “dear girl” (narrator’s romantic decision pending).
  - MAYBE: “fellow garden enthusiast” (recipient of foxgloves).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “winter… from your lips” — Shakespeare, *Troilus and Cressida* 4.5 (Achilles): “I’ll take what winter from your lips, fair lady…”
  - CERTAIN: “life’s fitful fever” (Macbeth allusion).
  - CERTAIN: “The Speckled Band” (Sherlock Holmes).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Smoking (“set fire to one end of him”).
  - “Electric Febrifuge” likely points to gelsemium/gelsemine (a named drug/poison; see research queue).
  - Gardening/poison: foxgloves (digitalis).
  - Bells: dangling bell-wire (Speckled Band echo).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Cheerfully menacing “generosity”; poison-by-gardening vibe; heavy literary reference density.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: prelude to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md (foxgloves/digitalis here ↔ “proved digitalis purpurea” there).
  - MAYBE: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md (shared “spare-room in this very house” anchor + continuation of the poison-by-gardening register).
  - MAYBE: gelsemium/electric-febrifuge let-down ↔ Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md (explicit gelsemium), but ordering is unclear.
  - MAYBE: bell motif cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md (bells + summoning “the man”).
  - MAYBE: garden/flower motif cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md (garden walk + flower-days).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If foxgloves are purely ornamental in later context (no illness/poison thread).
- **Research needed:**
  - (none)
