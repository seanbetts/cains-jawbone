I considered that venerable whose winter Achilles thought to take from the lips of Cressida. Why not? I set fire to one end of him, gloatingly, and my nerves benefited. Electric Febrifuge may be ; but bad for life’s fitful fever. Its active ingredient had finally let me down. I was nothing if not generous. I started my fellow garden enthusiast on the foxgloves. He would appreciate that if he knew. Yes, I was doing my best for the dear girl. I wished I could make up (she would appreciate this) my mind about her. If we did decide---and that weighed with a girl---she would not have to change the initials on her parti-panties. I thought of the old spare-room in this very house, where Mrs. Gay used to lie upon her visits. When I was ill, I was put there, with the only dangling bell-wire in all the place, descending behind my head. I used of course to have nightmares of the Speckled Band, and awfully scream down the house.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Mrs. Gay (visited/stayed in spare-room “in this very house”).
  - MAYBE: “dear girl” (narrator’s romantic decision pending).
  - MAYBE: “fellow garden enthusiast” (recipient of foxgloves).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “venerable whose winter Achilles thought to take from the lips of Cressida” (Troilus & Cressida line; exact wording TBD).
  - CERTAIN: “life’s fitful fever” (Macbeth allusion).
  - CERTAIN: “The Speckled Band” (Sherlock Holmes).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Smoking (“set fire to one end of him”).
  - Gardening/poison: foxgloves (digitalis).
  - Bells: dangling bell-wire (Speckled Band echo).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Cheerfully menacing “generosity”; poison-by-gardening vibe; heavy literary reference density.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: bell motif cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md (bells + summoning “the man”).
  - MAYBE: garden/flower motif cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md (garden walk + flower-days).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If foxgloves are purely ornamental in later context (no illness/poison thread).
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the exact Troilus & Cressida quotation (“winter… lips…”).
  - What is “Electric Febrifuge” (product/term) and what is its “active ingredient” here?
