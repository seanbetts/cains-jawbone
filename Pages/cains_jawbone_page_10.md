Then came Hyacinth’s day. He laughed when he remembered that, as we were walking round the garden, and said it was too late for Jasmine’s day at any rate. I liked to hear him laugh, and thought it was absurd for him to be called after what the man Boots didn’t understand. The latter’s way of expressing himself seemed to me childish ; why should we, of all people, use singular for plural and plural for singular? They went back two days and formulated their bet, till I could have howled. If he got the third point, she’d owe him a box of a hundred Egyptian cigarettes---Gourdoulis, and if she won, he’d give her three pairs of Etam dawn mist, ten inches. They looked so bright about it all. She drooped long seed pearl things right over the soup. Ear-drops, as my mother had called them, I never could abide ; probably because I belonged to the other side of the family. My mistress wore them ; was it for that that I had begun to tire of her already?

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: Hyacinth (male; “He laughed…”; name tied to something “Boots didn’t understand”).
  - MAYBE: Jasmine (female; referenced via “Jasmine’s day”).
  - CERTAIN: Boots (servant/“man Boots”).
  - MAYBE: narrator’s mistress (unnamed; wears seed-pearl ear-drops).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “Hyacinth’s day” / “Jasmine’s day” (calendar markers; likely saints’/named days).
  - CERTAIN: “They went back two days…” (explicit offset).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Gardens/flowers (hyacinth/jasmine); betting/gifts.
  - Cigarettes: “a hundred Egyptian cigarettes—Gourdoulis”.
  - Hosiery/lingerie: “Etam dawn mist, ten inches” (product clue).
  - Jewellery/ears: seed-pearl “ear-drops”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Social observation + mild contempt (Boots’ speech; “childish”); sexual/romantic weariness (“tire of her already”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: calendar cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md (Hyacinth’s day + “to-day” deaths).
  - MAYBE: garden/flower motif echo with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md (foxgloves).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Hyacinth’s day/Jasmine’s day” are shown to be private nicknames rather than public calendar anchors.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify which dates “Hyacinth’s day” and “Jasmine’s day” refer to (likely saints/feast days).
  - Identify “Gourdoulis” (Egyptian cigarettes) and “Etam dawn mist, ten inches” (what item/measure).
  - Interpret the singular/plural reversal complaint (dialect/wordplay?).
