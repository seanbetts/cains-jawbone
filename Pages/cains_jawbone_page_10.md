Then came Hyacinth’s day. He laughed when he remembered that, as we were walking round the garden, and said it was too late for Jasmine’s day at any rate. I liked to hear him laugh, and thought it was absurd for him to be called after what the man Boots didn’t understand. The latter’s way of expressing himself seemed to me childish ; why should we, of all people, use singular for plural and plural for singular? They went back two days and formulated their bet, till I could have howled. If he got the third point, she’d owe him a box of a hundred Egyptian cigarettes---Gourdoulis, and if she won, he’d give her three pairs of Etam dawn mist, ten inches. They looked so bright about it all. She drooped long seed pearl things right over the soup. Ear-drops, as my mother had called them, I never could abide ; probably because I belonged to the other side of the family. My mistress wore them ; was it for that that I had begun to tire of her already?

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: Hyacinth (male; “He laughed…”; name tied to something “Boots didn’t understand”).
  - MAYBE: Jasmine (female; referenced via “Jasmine’s day”).
  - CERTAIN: Boots (servant/“man Boots”).
  - MAYBE: narrator’s mistress (unnamed; wears seed-pearl ear-drops).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “Hyacinth’s day” likely St Hyacinth’s feast day = Aug 16 (Chambers’ *Book of Days*; *Catholic Encyclopedia* 1913).
  - MAYBE: “Jasmine’s day” remains unidentified (not found in Chambers; may not be a public calendar marker).
  - CERTAIN: “They went back two days…” (explicit offset).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Gardens/flowers (hyacinth/jasmine); betting/gifts.
  - Cigarettes: “a hundred Egyptian cigarettes—Gourdoulis” (advertised as “Gourdoulis’ Egyptian Cigarettes”, factory Alexandria) — *To-day* (1897) p. 86: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=unhNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA86&dq=Gourdoulis+Egyptian+cigarettes&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api.
  - Hosiery/lingerie: “Etam dawn mist, ten inches” — Etam is associated with stockings/hosiery (e.g., *The British Market for Hosiery* (1927) p. 8 mentions “Etam” as a French hosiery firm): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h8-YuNzprAIC&pg=PA8&dq=Etam+stockings&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api. (“dawn mist” likely a shade name; “ten inches” likely a size measure, but exact product spec unresolved (stalled; see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).)
  - Jewellery/ears: seed-pearl “ear-drops”.
  - Cross-page: calendar/offset language may recur with other “to-day”/feast-day anchors (keep as a continuity cue, not an ordering claim).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Social observation + mild contempt (Boots’ speech; “childish”); sexual/romantic weariness (“tire of her already”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md (p39 ends with a bet being made; this page explicitly “went back two days and formulated their bet…”).
  - MAYBE: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md if the “Hyacinth’s day” (Aug 16) anchor is part of a consecutive mid‑August daybook run leading into the Aug 17 “closing day in Potsdam” anchor. Weak support beyond dates: both pages use an object-naming aside in the same slot (“…, as my mother had called them” vs “…, as Jasmine might so easily have called them”) and both lean on dog-coded idiom (“could have howled” vs “three more left”).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Hyacinth’s day/Jasmine’s day” are shown to be private nicknames rather than public calendar anchors.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify what “Jasmine’s day” refers to (and whether it’s a public calendar anchor).
  - Stalled: confirm what “Etam dawn mist, ten inches” encodes (shade + the intended sizing/measurement system) (see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
  - Interpret the singular/plural reversal complaint (dialect/wordplay?).
