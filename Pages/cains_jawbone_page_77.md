Compact, they call it ; but when I used it, I was feeling anything but so. Don’t think me squeamish ; it was my first. The last little contact with the bony ankles, so warm and so soon, if Nature’s great force were to do its work, to be so cold, had touched me, I confess it. Though I was alone again, it took me a few minutes to visualise Henry’s predicament with the detached calm which it deserved. That old aunt of his third wife had turned up again. Strangely enough a jellyfish had plugged the solution of her motor boat’s continuity. And there she was back again, alert, suspicious, very much alive. I couldn’t help being sorry for Henry. And I couldn’t help being sorry for Perceval. Murders were funny things. That day’s killing of Perceval, and in so public a place, seemed to me unwarrantable. But I had never been strong on politics. For the other, my own, though it was understandable, there was perhaps no utter warrant.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry (has a “predicament”; his “old aunt of his third wife” returns).
  - CERTAIN: Henry’s “old aunt of his third wife” (unnamed; “very much alive”).
  - CERTAIN: Perceval (referenced as killed “that day”; likely historical Spencer Perceval, but confirm).
  - MAYBE: “jellyfish” (literal or figurative cause of motor-boat failure/return).
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator committed a murder (“it was my first”; warmth → cold of ankles).
  - MAYBE: weapon/tool called “Compact” (used by narrator; identify what it is).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “my first” (first killing).
  - MAYBE: “that day’s killing of Perceval” (could be a “to-day” calendar anchor).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Cool, reflective, slightly aesthetic about murder; distinguishes “public political” killing vs “my own”.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md (named-victim setup → first killing).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Perceval” is an in-world character rather than historical, or if “my first” refers to something non-lethal.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify what “Compact” refers to (weapon/tool) in period usage.
  - Confirm whether Perceval reference encodes a specific date.
