I had sufficient knowledge to realise that I had succeeded. I ordered Charles to spare no expense in confecting that Sundae known as Lover’s Delight for my companion. I believed in letting a man have a bit in. A couple of hours later the parson in the pulpit had, with his collaborator, done the trick. I looked down on what I had accomplished. Death closes all : but something ere the end, some work of noble note, may yet be done. That figurehead beard would plough the pseudo-scientific seas no more, at least. There had been other murders, of course, to-day, and with greater consequence. Francis Ferdinand’s, for instance. But never one that had left a man more dead. I gave the huddle farewell, and forbade Henry, my peerless investigator, to pursue the matter further. I climbed down from the short flight of folding steps upon which I had secured my inevitable heliographic record of success. No more by thee my steps shall be for ever and for ever.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry (called “my peerless investigator”).
  - CERTAIN: Charles (ordered to make “Lover’s Delight”; role TBD).
  - MAYBE: parson + “collaborator” (in pulpit; “did the trick”).
  - MAYBE: “figurehead beard” (target; likely Trinder given pseudo-science/beard cues).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day” (includes reference to Francis Ferdinand’s murder; potential date anchor).
  - CERTAIN: Francis Ferdinand reference → June 28, 1914 (Sarajevo assassination; 1922 *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, “Yugoslavia”).
  - CERTAIN: “a couple of hours later”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Death closes all… some work of noble note…” (Tennyson, *Ulysses*).
  - CERTAIN: “No more by thee my steps shall be, / For ever and for ever.” (Tennyson, “A Farewell” / “Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea”).
  - CERTAIN: Francis Ferdinand (historical assassination reference).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Food/menu: “Lover’s Delight” sundae (echoes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md).
  - Completion/success: narrator declares success; “man more dead”.
  - Photography: “heliographic record” taken from folding steps.
  - Henry-as-investigator instructed not to pursue further.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Self-congratulatory “work of noble note” framing; mixes moralising with logistics (dessert order, photo).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: links to Trinder thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md).
  - MAYBE: links to Lover’s Delight / bar-menu cluster (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “figurehead beard” is shown to be someone other than Trinder and Lover’s Delight is a generic term used widely.
- **Research needed:**
  - Clarify the parson/collaborator “did the trick” mechanism (sermon? marriage? execution?).
