I found myself by that one of the windows which overlooked the stone broach spire---a rarity in Kent---of Pluckley church, and the light would strike my book from over my right shoulder. I drew a volume from my pocket ; blind-tooled on the green in a double circle was a single star above what was perhaps a sea. I have had very little experience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married once. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person, and I wondered if such a reason for marriage would ever have occurred to me. I had never married, and scarcely felt like beginning now. It was the tenth edition, of 1917. No, Sir ; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it myself. Not a woman had entered as yet. I was in for a ticklish business, and I knew it. Forging ahead, I supposed they would call it, since the woman was not yet dead. You might not hear of her again.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Pluckley church (Kent) + its “stone broach spire”.
  - MAYBE: narrator (reading; planning something “ticklish”).
  - MAYBE: “the woman” (not yet dead; target of “forging ahead” scheme).
  - CERTAIN: the quoted “married once… misunderstanding… No, sir…” lines are from Oscar Wilde, *The Importance of Being Earnest*, Act I (Lane): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest/Act_I.
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “tenth edition, of 1917” (book edition).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Forgery/forging: “Forging ahead… since the woman was not yet dead.”
  - Book as clue: blind-tooled green binding with device “a single star above what was perhaps a sea”.
  - Church-view window orientation: light over right shoulder (positioning detail).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Dry evasiveness (“No, Sir; it is not a very interesting subject…”); self-contradictory marriage talk may be a quotation/echo.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: `N39` will/forgery voice pairing with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md (shared *Importance of Being Earnest* echo + explicit forgery framing; see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N39` block).
  - LIKELY: precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md as a waiting/prep beat (“Not a woman had entered as yet… Forging ahead… since the woman was not yet dead”) before the will/pen-work scene (“The will was there… caseful of strange pens”), with the same harm-to-target framing (“You might not hear of her again” ↔ “hurting the girl”); see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N39` Sequence A.
  - MAYBE: links to wills/inheritance/document cluster (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_18.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “forging ahead” later proves to be a non-criminal metaphor unrelated to documents.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) 1917 tenth-edition book: Oscar Wilde, *The Importance of Being Earnest* (the page quotes Act I verbatim): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest/Act_I. (Device likely a publisher’s mark; not yet corroborated.)
  - Confirm what “stone broach spire” rarity implies (place/route constraint).
