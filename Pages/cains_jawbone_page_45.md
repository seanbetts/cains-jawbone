It was when that half Pole, half Frenchman, and usually up the first half, that self-styled drunken mongrel and lazy waster, got normally out of bed. I remembered that when Hélène told him of her attachment he gave up brandy. And took to absinthe. It was one of the times that he had an absinthe. They said that it made the heart grow fonder. What had I actually seen? I had seen Henry---surely I had heard him called so---bending innocently over an innocent corpse of his own making. And I had also seen the doctor leading the old man up the garden, not once or twice, but many times. The girl was no longer there. I stayed myself with devilled Epicam and Royans aux Achard, levered into me with Peter Barleys and washed down and out, foul thought, with Villacabras. But one was so helpless alone in a great building of many flats : I was glad I had not given up stealing at the doors.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Hélène.
  - MAYBE: “half Pole, half Frenchman” (unnamed; described as a drunken waster).
  - MAYBE: Henry (seen bending over a corpse; narrator unsure the name is correct).
  - MAYBE: doctor (unnamed).
  - MAYBE: old man (led up the garden repeatedly).
  - MAYBE: “the girl” (gone).
- **Quotes/allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “half Pole, half Frenchman… drunken mongrel… lazy waster…” echoes Menyhért Lengyel, *Typhoon* (Methuen, 1913), p. 110 (tr. Laurence Irving): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fvY1AQAAIAAJ&dq=%22half%20Pole%22&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2
- **Wordplay (synthesis):**

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: homophone
- span: "Peter Barleys"
- reading: "Peter Barleys -> Peter Parley (Samuel Griswold Goodrich pseudonym)"
- confidence: med
- rationale: The menu-list context encourages phonetic punning; “Peter Parley” is a well-known period pseudonym.
- falsifier: “Peter Barleys” is confirmed as a literal brand/product name with no punning intent.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): allusion + homophone
- span: "Peter Barleys"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(homophone): Peter Barleys -> Peter Parley (Samuel Griswold Goodrich pseudonym)"
- confidence: med
- why it matters: narrator -> indicates a literary-allusion/pun style embedded in the “menu list”
- falsifiers:
  - “Peter Barleys” is later confirmed as a literal food/drink brand name in a period source
  - the surrounding list items are all literal brands with no punning intent

CANDIDATE
- mechanism: double definition
- span: "leading the old man up the garden"
- reading: "literal garden-walking + idiom “lead up the garden path” (= deceive)"
- confidence: med
- rationale: The phrasing reads like a deliberate idiom literalised in-scene, and echoes Page 29’s “led… up the garden” formulation.
- falsifier: Later evidence shows this is only a literal repeated walk with no deception/idiom intent.

LIKELY WORDPLAY
- mechanism(s): double definition
- span: "leading the old man up the garden"
- best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): literal garden-walking + “lead up the garden path” deception (echoes Page 29’s phrasing)"
- confidence: med
- why it matters: motif -> a cross-page phrase-level hook (Page 29/45) for a potential “garden deception” micro-strand
- falsifiers:
  - the phrase is shown to be generic/incidental and appears widely with no other shared anchors
  - later context forces a purely literal reading with no deception framing
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Proverb punning: absinthe/absence (“made the heart grow fonder”).
  - Corpse: Henry over “an innocent corpse of his own making”.
  - Food/drink list: devilled Epicam; Royans aux Achard; Peter Barleys; Villacabras.
    - Epicam: advertised as “EPICAM… the Worcestershire Ham” (Country Life, 1934): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rRYiAQAAMAAJ&dq=Epicam&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2
    - Epicure Ham Co. (Pershore, Worcs.) appears in Country Life Illustrated (1934): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OBYiAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22EPICURE%20HAM%22&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2
    - Royans aux Achard(s): trademark/label for canned “ROYANS AUX TRUFFES & AUX ACHARDS” (Flouit Frères & C., Bordeaux) recorded in *Bulletin officiel de la propriété industrielle et commerciale* (1886), p. 168 (deposit note dated 24 Feb 1887): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YKNuP7yATQYC&pg=RA2-PA168-IA147&vq=ROYANS
    - Villacabras: advertised as Spanish “Natural Mineral Purgative Water” (Occidental Medical Times, 1892): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WagRAAAAYAAJ&dq=VILLACABRAS&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2
  - Setting: “great building of many flats”; “stealing at the doors” (sneaking/eavesdropping/theft).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Proverb-twisting; vivid menu/brand listing; self-described stealth/thievery.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: add to Henry-occurrence cluster.
  - MAYBE: “led up the garden” echoes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md (garden/deception/old man thread).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “up the garden” later proves purely figurative and unrelated to the plant/poison plotline.
- **Research needed:**
  - Clarify what “usually up the first half” adds to the Typhoon-derived phrase.
