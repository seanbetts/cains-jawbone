It was when that half Pole, half Frenchman, and usually up the first half, that self-styled drunken mongrel and lazy waster, got normally out of bed. I remembered that when Hélène told him of her attachment he gave up brandy. And took to absinthe. It was one of the times that he had an absinthe. They said that it made the heart grow fonder. What had I actually seen? I had seen Henry---surely I had heard him called so---bending innocently over an innocent corpse of his own making. And I had also seen the doctor leading the old man up the garden, not once or twice, but many times. The girl was no longer there. I stayed myself with devilled Epicam and Royans aux Achard, levered into me with Peter Barleys and washed down and out, foul thought, with Villacabras. But one was so helpless alone in a great building of many flats : I was glad I had not given up stealing at the doors.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Hélène.
  - MAYBE: “half Pole, half Frenchman” (unnamed; described as a drunken waster).
  - MAYBE: Henry (seen bending over a corpse; narrator unsure the name is correct).
  - MAYBE: doctor (unnamed).
  - MAYBE: old man (led up the garden repeatedly).
  - MAYBE: “the girl” (gone).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Proverb punning: absinthe/absence (“made the heart grow fonder”).
  - Corpse: Henry over “an innocent corpse of his own making”.
  - Deception/walking: doctor “leading the old man up the garden” (literal + idiom).
  - Food/drink list: devilled Epicam; Royans aux Achard; Peter Barleys; Villacabras.
  - Setting: “great building of many flats”; “stealing at the doors” (sneaking/eavesdropping/theft).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Proverb-twisting; vivid menu/brand listing; self-described stealth/thievery.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: add to Henry-occurrence cluster.
  - MAYBE: “led up the garden” echoes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md (garden/deception/old man thread).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “up the garden” later proves purely figurative and unrelated to the plant/poison plotline.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify Epicam / Royans aux Achard / Peter Barleys / Villacabras.
  - Clarify the “half Pole, half Frenchman… usually up the first half” phrasing.
