And then with horrid clearness I had seen a woman---not actually, if I could trust myself, there ; but aiming, directing, inspiring : slim, tawny, petulant, self-willed : wanton, but too calculated to be more than mistress of herself ; the kind that had made England terribly at sea. I looked back on my own youth ; I had been about a bit, as they say ; sometimes, to catch a whale, I had cast a sprat over the windmill. But it was not till my marriage with Henry that old Charles Goodfellow dared to hint that I was going gay. Poor lonely little Bat. But it was still the first dog, I couldn’t help realising that, after my husband’s training. Just as I could not help realising that, had I a mind to go there, I could now get moled and isled on the Selfridget side, though by no means in Bond Street. When I said means, I meant of course lawful ones. Then I remembered Henry’s favourite quotation : 


        But M’Cullough ‘e wanted cabins with marble
                and maple and all
        And Brussels an’ Utrecht velvet, and bath and a 
                Social Hall

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry (husband).
  - CERTAIN: Charles Goodfellow.
  - MAYBE: “Bat” (nickname; “Poor lonely little Bat.”).
  - MAYBE: unnamed “woman… aiming, directing, inspiring” (slim, tawny, self-willed).
  - MAYBE: M’Cullough (in quoted stanza; may be fictional).
- **Time markers:**
  - MAYBE: “first dog” (could mean first dog-watch; or literal dog after Henry’s training).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Selfridges (“Selfridget side”).
  - CERTAIN: Bond Street.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - Henry’s favourite quotation (M’Cullough stanza about cabins with marble/maple and “Social Hall”).
- **Wordplay:**
  - Mixed idioms: “to catch a whale… cast a sprat over the windmill” (proverb-scrambling).
  - “moled and isled” (cryptic place/wordplay; interpretation TBD).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Marriage to Henry; hints about “going gay”.
  - Dog/dog-watch register.
  - Lawful “means” emphasis; shopping geography (Selfridges vs Bond Street).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Malapropism/idiom-mixing; dense punning place language.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: add to Henry-occurrence cluster.
  - MAYBE: links to dog-watch register pages (e.g., Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md).
  - MAYBE: London/Surrey place-wordplay thread (Selfridges/Bond Street ↔ Dittons/Mole area pages).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “first dog” is later clearly literal (not timekeeping) and the Henry here is a distinct Henry.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the M’Cullough quotation source.
  - Interpret “moled and isled” / “Selfridget side” phrasing.
