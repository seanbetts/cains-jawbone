        The swallow, the bright Homonoea. 


I wondered if I should succeed in hurting the girl. But think of her no more. The will was there all right. And the wonderful hands at the opposite side of the table were at work with a caseful of strange pens. I sat quite still ; neither in life nor letters will I consent to jump about. I begin at the beginning, even if you think it prosy of me to say so, and go straight through to the end. To be born, or at any rate bred, in a handbag, whether it had handles or not, seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds one of the worst excesses of the French Revolution. The man had certainly got into his stride at last. The fellow seemed absorbed. It is a marvellous gift, I always think. He could undoubtedly have written, if he’d had a mind, like a Chesterton or a Camoens.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - MAYBE: “the girl” (target of intended hurt; unnamed).
  - CERTAIN: “the man” with “wonderful hands” and a caseful of pens (unnamed).
  - CERTAIN: Chesterton; Camoens (comparison targets).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Wills/documents: “The will was there all right.”
  - Writing/forgery: “caseful of strange pens”; “wonderful hands” working.
  - Violence hesitation: “hurting the girl… think of her no more.”
  - Family/decency obsession (handbag birth rhetoric + French Revolution comparison).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - “I begin at the beginning… go straight through to the end” (echoes Alice-in-Wonderland trial phrasing; likely deliberate).
  - “to be born… in a handbag… whether it had handles or not…” (strongly echoes Wilde’s *Importance of Being Earnest*).
  - “The swallow, the bright Homonoea.” (source unclear).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Pedantic insistence on order (“begin at the beginning”); admiration of writerly facility.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: links to wills/forgery cluster (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md).
  - MAYBE: links to pens/handwriting pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “will” and pen-work are later revealed to be unrelated (metaphorical) rather than document-writing/forgery.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the “Homonoea” line source and why it heads the passage.
