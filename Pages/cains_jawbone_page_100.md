I dimly guess why the old dead so wanted this. I had worked for him, Henry had worked for him. If I could get up, as, believe me, I cannot, I would have a thing to say to her. She lolls over at me gloating, her mouth blood-tinted on the puma freckle of her beauty. Why should I think of Henry at this particular juncture? I have it. Scotland Yard, of course. And little ‘twill matter to one. A sorry thing to be last noticed : the buttonhole has escaped from the buttonholer. He, the reckless old cock, slips down past Woolworth’s and she continues full-sail toward the Kursal, as flush---oh, you wicked woman---as May. The girl is smiling at me. That’s not so good. Here I shake off the bur o’ the world, man’s congregation shun. O beastly woman. You know not how ill’s all here, about my heart ; but I know. Henry, I feel it, is for the first and last time getting out of hand. Good-bye, Henry. He drops awa. . . . .

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”; physically incapacitated: “believe me, I cannot” get up).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; “Good-bye, Henry. He drops awa…”).
  - CERTAIN: “her” / “beastly woman” (unnamed; gloating over narrator).
  - CERTAIN: “old dead” (unnamed dead person for whom narrator and Henry worked).
  - CERTAIN: “reckless old cock” (unnamed “he” slipping past Woolworth’s).
  - MAYBE: “the girl” (smiling at narrator).
  - MAYBE: May (used as a comparison “flush… as May”; could be person/month).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: Scotland Yard (invoked explicitly).
  - CERTAIN: Woolworth’s (store/landmark reference).
  - LIKELY: Kursal = Kursaal, Southend(-on-Sea), Essex (e.g., “Kursaal, Southend” in *The Freemason and Masonic Illustrated* (1909), p. 14): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zpowAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA14&dq=Kursaal%2C+Southend&source=gbs_api.
- **Death/violence cues:**
  - LIKELY: narrator is in extremis (heart distress; cannot rise; valedictory tone).
  - MAYBE: antagonistic woman is implicated by gloating posture and “blood-tinted” mouth (possible poisoning/violence).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Buttonhole motif (“buttonhole has escaped from the buttonholer”).
  - Police/detection frame (Scotland Yard) collides with personal collapse.
  - Henry “getting out of hand” (suggests Henry is physically controlled/handled in this scene).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Here I shake off the bur o’ the world, man’s congregation shun” = Francis Thompson, “An Anthem of Earth” (in *New Poems*, 1897), p. 93: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SZo-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&dq=bur+o%27+the+world&source=gbs_api.
  - CERTAIN: “how ill all’s here about my heart” echoes Shakespeare, *Hamlet* Act V (“…I shall win at the odds… thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart…”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1917)_Yale/Text/Act_V.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: belongs with the Henry + Scotland Yard / detective cluster (police framing + Henry present).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the collapse/death framing is revealed as purely rhetorical (no actual in-world harm).
- **Research needed:**
  - Clarify whether “May” here is the person (`P16`) or a month/colour simile.
