        Just broken to twine round they harp-strings, as if
                no wild beat
        Were now raging to torture the desert! Then I,
                as was meet…


I assure you I had not seen her enter  but suddenly I was electrically aware that she was sitting near me. What could come next? I had let Henry guide me. She was very tall ; sometimes, I think, tallness is an excellent thing in women. Julienne? Yes, she looked as if her name would be of the sort. And I surmised dark eyes under golden lashes. I hardly liked to disturb the surface for the first time. Her voice purred in my quick ears ; I thought of a jaguar on a lean bough, and envied Henry. The surface was clear brown, and I discerned white figures within ; stars, and a little heart, mirabile dictu, were moving inside. She lit a cigarette and poured down cocktail after cocktail ; sometimes she made little dabbings with a butterfly of white lace to her mouth.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - MAYBE: tall woman (“Julienne?” as a name-guess).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Robert Browning, “Saul” (*Men and Women*, 1855): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Men_and_Women_(Browning)/Volume_2/Saul (includes “Just broken to twine round thy harp-strings… Were now raging to torture the desert!”).
  - “mirabile dictu” (Latin aside).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Seduction/observation: “electrically aware” of her presence; envy of Henry.
  - Cigarette + heavy cocktail drinking.
  - “Surface… clear brown” with white figures (stars/heart) moving inside (eye vs drink detail; unclear).
  - White lace “butterfly” dabbing.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Sensory, eroticised description; fixates on eyes/surface.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: preceded by Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md (Browning “Saul” stanza continuation: “...living and blue” → “Just broken to twine...”).
  - MAYBE: followed later by Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md as a “she has got me” tea beat (pending whether p47’s “she” is this same woman; see `Order/hypotheses.md` `N21` Sequence C).
  - MAYBE: links to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md (same woman/cocktail-bar setting).
  - MAYBE: links to Flecker/allusion-heavy narrator thread (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md) if the verse is related.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If the “surface” detail is later clearly an object/drink unrelated to gaze/character.
- **Research needed:**
  - Clarify what the “surface… clear brown” refers to (eye/cup/drink).
