He was picking round among all she had left behind and found a box with his name on it. Also it said, for he read it, I always pay my debts. Unwrapped, it seemed to be a hundred box of Gourdoulis. I had never seen him so moved. He started reading a letter from a woman, dead the same day. I had yours but yesterday, it sai, though dated the third of February, in which you suppose me to be dead and buried. I have already let you know I am still alive, he went on, but to say truth, I look upon my present circumstances to be exactly the same with those of departed spirits. I don’t think he ever said any more. Happily I was behind the armchair. He just opened the box. I had never seen him so moved. There were little bits of stuff like black pineapple on the carpet. I knew he could never be his old collected self again, and that my gray hairs would go down in sorrow to the grave.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Gourdoulis (100 box; cigarette brand).
  - MAYBE: “he” (recipient; name on box; deeply moved).
  - MAYBE: “she” (left items behind).
  - MAYBE: letter-writer (woman; “dead the same day”).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: letter dated “the third of February”.
  - CERTAIN: “yesterday” appears inside the quoted letter.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “I had yours but yesterday… dated the third of February…” / “departed spirits” — Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (published letters from the Constantinople period): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SYktgDb_eXQC&pg=PA100&dq=%22I+had+yours+but+yesterday%22
  - MAYBE: “my gray hairs would go down in sorrow to the grave” (biblical echo).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Debts/bills: “I always pay my debts” label.
  - Tobacco/cigarettes: Gourdoulis + “little bits of stuff like black pineapple” (LIKELY loose tobacco from opened/handled cigarettes; “pine-apple” can mean “fir-cone”).
  - Letters + death-status ambiguity (writer “still alive” yet “departed spirits”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Voyeur/observer behind the armchair; melodramatic biblical phrasing.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: within `N25`, precedes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md (debts/bills + “petty employ” / covert manipulation register).
  - MAYBE: overlaps Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md via the Gourdoulis cigarette brand; do not use for cross-strand sequencing unless a second independent continuity anchor appears.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Gourdoulis” is later shown to be something other than cigarettes.
  - If the debt/bills framing proves generic and no additional phrase-level anchor links this scene to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md.
- **Research needed:**
  - (Resolved) The quoted letter is Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (published letters from the Constantinople period): “I had yours but yesterday… dated the third of February… I look upon my present circumstances to be exactly the same with those of departed spirits…” https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SYktgDb_eXQC&pg=PA100&dq=%22I+had+yours+but+yesterday%22. In Page 33’s framing, “dead the same day” most likely refers to the in-world woman whose effects include the letter (ironic against the letter’s “still alive” claim).
  - (Resolved) “black pineapple” is LIKELY loose dark tobacco spilled from the cigarette box; “pine-apple” is noted as an old English term for “fir-cone” (EB1911 “Heraldry”: “armorists have not surrendered this, our ancient word for the ‘fir-cone,’ to the foreign ananas”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Heraldry).
