He was picking round among all she had left behind and found a box with his name on it. Also it said, for he read it, I always pay my debts. Unwrapped, it seemed to be a hundred box of Gourdoulis. I had never seen him so moved. He started reading a letter from a woman, dead the same day. I had yours but yesterday, it sai, though dated the third of February, in which you suppose me to be dead and buried. I have already let you know I am still alive, he went on, but to say truth, I look upon my present circumstances to be exactly the same with those of departed spirits. I don’t think he ever said any more. Happily I was behind the armchair. He just opened the box. I had never seen him so moved. There were little bits of stuff like black pineapple on the carpet. I knew he could never be his old collected self again, and that my gray hairs would go down in sorrow to the grave.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Gourdoulis (100 box; cigarette brand).
  - MAYBE: “he” (recipient; name on box; deeply moved).
  - MAYBE: “she” (left items behind).
  - MAYBE: letter-writer (woman; “dead the same day”).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: letter dated “the third of February”.
  - CERTAIN: “yesterday” appears inside the quoted letter.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - MAYBE: “I had yours but yesterday… dated the third of February…” / “departed spirits” line (letter source TBD).
  - MAYBE: “my gray hairs would go down in sorrow to the grave” (biblical echo).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Debts/bills: “I always pay my debts” label.
  - Tobacco/cigarettes: Gourdoulis + “little bits of stuff like black pineapple”.
  - Letters + death-status ambiguity (writer “still alive” yet “departed spirits”).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Voyeur/observer behind the armchair; melodramatic biblical phrasing.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: links to Page 10’s Gourdoulis and the brand/cigarette motif.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Gourdoulis” is later shown to be something other than cigarettes.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the quoted letter source (who wrote it, and what “dead the same day” refers to).
  - What are the “black pineapple” bits (tobacco/food/other)?
