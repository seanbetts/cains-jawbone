I sit down alone at the appointed table and take up my pen to give all whom it may concern an exact account of what may happen. Call me nervous, call me fey, if you will ; at least this little pen, this mottled black and silver Aquarius, with its nib specially tempered to my order in Amsterdam, is greedy. It has not had much work since it flew so nimbly for the dead old man. As I watch the sea, Casy Ferris passes with down-dropped eyes. Of course, to-day is the day. Her father reminds me of a valetudinarian walrus. But she has, I suppose, to have somebody. St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine is full, no doubt, already. I think she is rash ; but it is none of my business. Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying, my heart remembers how. Strange that he comes into my head so much to-day. I hope it’s over some flotsam fish that the birds are making whaupee. But all the nice gulls love a sailor. Ugh.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Casy Ferris; Casy’s father (unnamed).
  - MAYBE: “St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine” (place/institution; reads like a church/venue in a coastal chine, or a “lazar-house”/infirmary by name).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “to-day is the day” (event for Casy; likely scheduled/ritual).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying, my heart remembers how.” — Robert Louis Stevenson, “To S. R. Crockett” (*Songs of Travel and Other Verses*, 1896): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Songs_of_Travel_and_Other_Verses/To_S._R._Crockett.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Pen: “mottled black and silver Aquarius”, nib “tempered… in Amsterdam”.
  - Sea/birds: “whaups” (curlews), gulls, “sailor”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Fixation on objects (pen) + lyrical sea/bird imagery; abrupt disgust (“Ugh.”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: coastal-setting cluster (sea + “Chine”); compare with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md (sea/lighthouse motifs).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Chine” is metaphorical or later placed away from sea.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify/locate “St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine”.
