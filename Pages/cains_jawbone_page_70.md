It flashed through my mind that the place between Eros and the Queen’s Hall had horribly changed since Orpen painted it in 1912, also that even if I took the warnings of the Ming and got there instantaneously, my modest Munich would have to bracket, at my expense, with islands more correctly known as Efate. BNut after all I was not going. Rather I intended to finish what I had begun. The girl would find it in the morning, franked, and all ready to go upon its way. I had told all I knew, and felt very tired. Would he ignore what I had said, leaving me to do my worst? And if so, what worst could I do? Or would he come to me and cringe for silence, relying on our old association, when he had babbled at me knee, the arthritic one, that surely the cabbage butterflies were fragments of a poem God had written and, as being too good for us, torn up? Or would he simply try to do me in?

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: “the girl” (recipient who will find something “franked” in the morning).
  - MAYBE: “he” (target of narrator’s warning/knowledge; may retaliate; identity unclear).
  - MAYBE: “he” with arthritic knee who talked of cabbage butterflies as “fragments of a poem God had written” (could be the “old man” from Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md / Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md; confirm).
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: “Eros” (Piccadilly Circus statue) + Queen’s Hall (London) corridor/route reference.
  - CERTAIN: Orpen painting is “The Café Royal” (1911–12) (R. P., *Sir William Orpen* (1923), Plate 16): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hCChAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA16&dq=CAFE+ROYAL.
  - CERTAIN: Efate (Efaté) is an island in the New Hebrides, also called “Sandwich island” (EB1911 “New Hebrides”, footnote): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/New_Hebrides
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “in the morning” (letter/package discovered then).
  - CERTAIN: Orpen “painted it in 1912” (historical anchor for the London place-change observation).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Letter/blackmail dynamics: “franked” item; narrator has “told all I knew” and waits for reaction.
  - Threat escalation: “try to do me in”.
  - Child-at-knee intimacy used as leverage (“old association”).
  - LIKELY: the “old association”/childhood-contact thread matches Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md’s “neglecting my contact with his infancy” while writing the full account.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Overheated associative leaps; heavy wordplay (“Ming”/Munich/Efate) amid fear and fatigue.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - LIKELY: follows Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md (written account completed → franked item left for “the girl” to find in the morning).
  - MAYBE: later consequence of the Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md / Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md old-man strand (retaliation fear after witnessing and/or reporting the slow-death scene).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “he” is clearly a different person from the “old man” and the letter is unrelated to the death scene.
- **Research needed:**
  - Interpret “warnings of the Ming”, “modest Munich”, and “Efate” bracket wordplay (Efate itself is pinned as an island name, but the intended bracket/cipher operation remains unclear).
