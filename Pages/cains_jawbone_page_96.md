Now I think I will try a cup of what they insolently call Golden Tips, a find young Tippy Tea. And then they say specifically No Tips. It is very disheartening. While I am waiting for it, and for the possible her, I study the only literature before me. What is a Loganberry Kiss? Is it at all like the Plover’s Lunch, that hurts and is desired? It is strange to think that Catharine is even at this moment turning a Somerset in front of the altar. The whole business reminds me of the time we lay outside Jifjaffa, and the Padre said to me : “I would rather have written that poem than take castor oil in the morning.” I had been reading him my Ode on the Intimations of Immorality in Early Childhood. Well, well. How vividly, whenever I adventure on stew now, I remember the stew we had that night. How it all comes back. The whole circumstances of this meeting are so mysterious. It gars me grue, if I may be permitted the expression.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - MAYBE: “her” (anticipated arrival; “possible her”).
  - CERTAIN: Catharine (named; “turning a Somerset in front of the altar”).
  - CERTAIN: the Padre (unnamed; war/expedition anecdote).
- **Objects/motifs:**
  - Tea: “Golden Tips” / “Tippy Tea”; “No Tips” gag.
  - Menu-like phrases: “Loganberry Kiss”; “Plover’s Lunch”.
  - Castor oil; stew recollection.
- **Places:**
  - MAYBE: Jifjaffa (unidentified; sounds like Jaffa/Palestine but unclear).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: Wordsworth-parody title “Ode on the Intimations of Immorality in Early Childhood” (Intimations of Immortality echo).
  - CERTAIN: Scots phrasing “It gars me grue” = “it makes me shudder”: “Gar… To cause; to make. [Obs. or Scot.]” (Webster 1913, https://www.websters1913.com/words/Gar) + “Grue… to shudder” (Chambers’s Twentieth Century Dictionary, 1908: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Grope_Gyve).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Menu-sleuthing + wartime memory intrusions; frames the meeting as “mysterious”.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Catharine” and “Padre” are purely anecdotal/allusive with no recurrence.
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify “Jifjaffa” (place or pun) and what “turning a Somerset” is encoding here.
  - Identify whether “Loganberry Kiss” / “Plover’s Lunch” are specific menu/culture references.
