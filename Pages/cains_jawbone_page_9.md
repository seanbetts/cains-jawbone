The sound of the bell, as of a boding gnat, just came to me. The finger causing it was, I knew, the index of a most skilful hand, one I had commanded, one that would pluck me from embarrassment, and yet one I vaguely distrusted. Really, if the lower orders don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of responsibility…. One had to be in the key for such things. I felt I should enjoy it as I got used to it. The bell again, and then a far sensation of feet. I was glad the man had come ; time was not unlimited. I remembered that, when I was returning after a fortnight’s absence during which my assistant Charles Day had deputised for me in my lectures on mineralogy at Peebles University, a tactless hand had left on the blackboard : “Let us work while it is yet Day ; for the Knight cometh when no man can work.”

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Charles Day (assistant; deputised in lectures).
  - CERTAIN: Peebles University (mineralogy lectures).
  - MAYBE: “the man” (summoned by bell; lower-orders hand/finger).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “a fortnight’s absence”; “time was not unlimited”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: “Let us work while it is yet Day; for the Knight cometh when no man can work.” (pun on John 9:4 “day/night”).
- **Wordplay:**
  - CERTAIN: Day/Knight substitution in the biblical line.
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Bells/summoning; class hierarchy (“lower orders”).
  - Academia/professional identity (mineralogy lecturer).
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Snobbish, managerial; expects obedience; distrusts but relies on skilled subordinate.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: bell motif cluster with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md (bell-wire + bell focus).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If bell references resolve to unrelated settings/narrators with no continuity.
- **Research needed:**
  - Is “Peebles University” a real/period reference or a joke? Track if Charles Day reappears.
