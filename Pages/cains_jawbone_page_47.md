Babs now moves across the vision, crowned with two straight downfalls, as it were, of copper upon her head. The uncurling flow is to right and left, as if a river, reflecting a thunder sunset, had split in terror into twin cataracts. And here, thank heaven, come the first, much needed rain of the week. A greyness and a spray to begin with, and suddenly a birth of little silver frogs all along the road. We were sitting in the verandah in the dead, hot, close air, gasping and praying that the black-blue clouds would let down and bring the cool. I always think of that, even in England. But, looking across at the figure opposite me, I realise that it is actually she and not Babs that has got me. Got me, that is a terrible conjunction of two little words ; Henry does not like it at all. But as a proof that what I say is true, she is strong enough to wean me from my thoughts of Orange Pekoe to a Special Orange Supreme.

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: Babs.
  - CERTAIN: Henry.
  - MAYBE: unnamed “she” (opposite narrator; “has got me”).
- **Time markers:**
  - CERTAIN: “first… rain of the week”.
- **Places:**
  - CERTAIN: England (memory persists “even in England”).
  - MAYBE: a hot verandah setting (likely abroad; exact place unknown).
- **Motifs/continuity hooks:**
  - Weather shift: drought → first rain; “little silver frogs” on the road.
  - Hair description: “two… downfalls… of copper… twin cataracts”.
  - Tea: Orange Pekoe → Special Orange Supreme.
    - “Special Orange Supreme” is attested as a menu item name in *The Hotel Monthly* (menus section): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uLvmAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA29&dq=Special+Orange+Supreme.
  - Henry policing diction: dislikes “got me”.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Highly visual, metaphor-heavy; keeps returning to sensory weather memories.
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: add to Henry-occurrence cluster.
  - MAYBE: follows the Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md run as a later “she has got me” beat (if the “she” matches p42’s tall woman). Falsifier: “she” is shown to be a different person than p42’s woman, or the tea vocabulary is coded/unrelated.
  - MAYBE: links to tea pages (e.g., Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md) via Orange Pekoe/tea naming.
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If “Orange Pekoe / Special Orange Supreme” turns out to be non-tea (menu/code) rather than beverage continuity.
- **Research needed:**
  - Track whether Babs recurs (and whether Babs vs “she” are distinct).
