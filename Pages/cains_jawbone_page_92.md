My earlier days had been so different. There hadn’t been the comfort, the sense of indulgence, or of adventure, that there was now. I bit into the last of the oysters and someone carried away the shells. It had been, as I say, so different. Cascading down the bombazine of my great aunt’s knee, what futility! When all her desire had been to give me a lap. What frustration of her, and incidentally of myself, when to be nursed by her and to submit to her stories had meant access to that secret caddis-hoard of Devona or of minty humbugs. I wondered what Henry would think of next. I had plenty of time, my watch said. My eyes had groped foolishly at the barren moon of the near-by clock, and then fallen away. My watch must be my mentor. I felt perhaps sillily ready for some sort of cardiac revelation, or revaluation at least.


        Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved!
                God’s child with his dew
        On they gracious gold hair, and those lilies still
                living and blue

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; narrator anticipates “what Henry would think of next”).
  - CERTAIN: great aunt (unnamed; childhood lap/stories).
- **Objects/motifs:**
  - Food: oysters; “minty humbugs”.
  - Timepieces: watch vs near-by clock (“my watch must be my mentor”).
  - Childhood sweets stash: “Devona” (a branded sweetmeat made from Devonshire/clotted cream; sold in 1d/3d packets — E. Skuse, *Skuse’s Complete Confectioner* (1894): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jdFH7L3xLjwC&pg=PT9; *Home Notes* (1895): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FVC2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA233) and “minty humbugs”.
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: quoted lines “Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved! …” — Robert Browning, “Saul” (*Men and Women*, 1855), Page:Men_and_Women,_Volume_2_-_Browning_(1855).djvu/120.
  - LIKELY: “caddis-hoard” echoes Kipling’s “Tomlinson” (1892): “As children rifle a caddis-case or the raven’s foolish hoard.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ballads_and_Barrack-Room_Ballads/Tomlinson.
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Nostalgic self-comparison (childhood frustration → present indulgence) + heightened anticipatory mood (“cardiac revelation”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - CERTAIN: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md (Browning “Saul” stanza continues directly into p42).
  - MAYBE: preceded by Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md (p49 “first introduction to Henry” → p92 familiarity/anticipation). Falsifier: Henry identity/role is incompatible across the pages.
  - MAYBE: sits near other timepiece-driven planning pages (watch/clock emphasis).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Henry here is clearly a different “Henry” than adjacent segments (setting/role divergence).
- **Research needed:**
  - RESOLVED: “Devona” is a branded sweetmeat (see `Indexes/research_queue.md`).
