My earlier days had been so different. There hadn’t been the comfort, the sense of indulgence, or of adventure, that there was now. I bit into the last of the oysters and someone carried away the shells. It had been, as I say, so different. Cascading down the bombazine of my great aunt’s knee, what futility! When all her desire had been to give me a lap. What frustration of her, and incidentally of myself, when to be nursed by her and to submit to her stories had meant access to that secret caddis-hoard of Devona or of minty humbugs. I wondered what Henry would think of next. I had plenty of time, my watch said. My eyes had groped foolishly at the barren moon of the near-by clock, and then fallen away. My watch must be my mentor. I felt perhaps sillily ready for some sort of cardiac revelation, or revaluation at least.


        Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved!
                God’s child with his dew
        On they gracious gold hair, and those lilies still
                living and blue

## Notes

- **Entities:**
  - CERTAIN: narrator (“I”).
  - CERTAIN: Henry (named; narrator anticipates “what Henry would think of next”).
  - CERTAIN: great aunt (unnamed; childhood lap/stories).
- **Objects/motifs:**
  - Food: oysters; “minty humbugs”.
  - Timepieces: watch vs near-by clock (“my watch must be my mentor”).
  - Childhood sweets stash (“secret caddis-hoard of Devona”).
- **Quotes & allusions:**
  - CERTAIN: quoted lines “Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved! …”
- **Voice/tells:**
  - Nostalgic self-comparison (childhood frustration → present indulgence) + heightened anticipatory mood (“cardiac revelation”).
- **Ordering hypotheses:**
  - MAYBE: sits near other timepiece-driven planning pages (watch/clock emphasis).
- **Disconfirming evidence:**
  - If Henry here is clearly a different “Henry” than adjacent segments (setting/role divergence).
- **Research needed:**
  - Identify the source of the quoted stanza (“Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved!”).
  - Identify what “Devona” refers to in “caddis-hoard of Devona” (place/brand/wordplay).
