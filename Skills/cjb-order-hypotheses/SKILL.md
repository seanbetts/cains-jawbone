# Cain’s Jawbone — Order Hypotheses

## Non-negotiables

- No brute force ordering attempts.
- Every proposed linkage must include disconfirming evidence.
- Prefer clusters first; do not try to force a single global order early.

## Primary file

- `Order/hypotheses.md`

## Method

### Pass 1: Clusters

Create clusters based on:

- voice/tells (diction, punctuation habits, obsessions, profession knowledge)
- recurring motifs/objects
- recurring named entities
- shared quote/allusion anchors
- time/place constraints

For each cluster, record:

- **Pages**
- **Rationale**
- **Key anchors**
- **Disconfirming evidence** (what would break the cluster)

### Pass 2: Intra-cluster ordering

Order within a cluster using:

- time markers (yesterday/tomorrow, meals, holidays, editions)
- place continuity (routes, venues, travel constraints)
- object continuity (letters, tools, injuries, pills/poisons)
- quote anchors (same source used in a progressive/echoing way)

For each candidate sequence, record:

- **Why** (1–3 bullets)
- **Confidence** (`CERTAIN/LIKELY/MAYBE`)
- **Disconfirming evidence** (specific tests)

### Pass 3: Cross-cluster joins (later)

Only attempt when there are strong anchors (time/place/explicit references), and keep alternatives alive.
