# Cain’s Jawbone — Motive & Relationships

## Non-negotiables

- Don’t assume murder: capture relationship evidence and escalation vectors.
- Keep claims falsifiable and evidence-based.

## When to use

Trigger this skill when:

- two characters interact or are observed together
- a narrator describes obligation, irritation, affection, hierarchy, dependence
- money, inheritance, employment, caretaking, or “duties” are emphasised

## Procedure

1. Identify the relationship edge(s):
   - `A → B` (who is speaking/acting toward whom)
2. Record:
   - **Relationship type:** spouse/lover/family/employer/servant/friend/stranger/etc.
   - **Power imbalance:** who controls resources, movement, information, reputation
   - **Emotional valence:** affectionate/resentful/fearful/admiring/disgusted/etc.
   - **Escalation vectors:** what could push this toward harm (money, jealousy, exposure, boredom, duty)
3. Update `Indexes/people.md`:
   - add relationships under the relevant `Pxx` entries (pronouns/relationships)
   - update tells that support motive (habits, dependencies, threats)
4. If the relationship evidence meaningfully changes a death/violence hypothesis, run `Skills/cjb-murder-analysis/SKILL.md` (so cast/confidence stay in sync).
5. If narrator psychology/voice is revealing, record it under the page’s `## Notes` (**Voice/tells**) and, if it clusters, in `Order/hypotheses.md`.

## Output checklist

- Relationship edge(s) captured in page `## Notes` (when relevant)
- `Indexes/people.md` updated with relationship + motive-relevant tells
