# Cain’s Jawbone — Quote Research

## Non-negotiables

- Quote only the minimum fragment needed to identify a reference.
- Do not paste large page text blocks into indices.
- Record uncertainty explicitly; do not “lock in” a source without evidence.

## Where to write

- Per-page: `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_N.md` under `## Notes`
- Global index: `Indexes/quotes.md`
- Open questions: `Indexes/research_queue.md`

## Workflow

1. Extract the smallest identifying snippet (often 5–15 words).
2. In the page’s `## Notes`, record:
   - snippet
   - suspected source/author (if any)
   - why it might matter (date anchor, thematic marker, voice tell)
   - confidence
3. Add/update an entry in `Indexes/quotes.md` with the same information and page links.
4. If identification is uncertain, add an `open` item to `Indexes/research_queue.md`.

## If browsing is enabled by the user

Do targeted lookups (quotes, proper nouns, locations) and record results in:

- `Indexes/quotes.md` (for quotes)
- `Indexes/places.md` (for locations)
- `Indexes/research_queue.md` (mark resolved + result)
