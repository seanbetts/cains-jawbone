# Ordering hypotheses

Record clusters and candidate sequences with reasons and falsifiers.

## Clusters

Template:

- **Cluster:** (short label)
  - **Pages:**  
  - **Rationale:**  
  - **Key anchors:** (quotes, motifs, time/place)  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** (what would falsify this cluster)  

- **Cluster:** Henry name occurrences (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md
  - **Rationale:** “Henry” appears across multiple scenes with shifting roles; may be one person or multiple people sharing the name.
  - **Key anchors:** “Lesurques” (Courier of Lyons?) role reference; ruined lighthouse + “Emperor’s Peg”; capstan-bar / dog-watch nautical register; Henry stooping/cleaning and handling bodies; Page 21’s “latest victim” + blood; Page 26’s “first two killings” + companion/rector’s aunt; Page 35’s police manhunt; Page 36’s buried corpse detail + “made up”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages give different surnames/biographical details for each “Henry”, or show mutually exclusive locations/timelines.

- **Cluster:** Coastal imagery (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated sea-adjacent cues (Chine, tumbling into sea, lighthouse) suggest a shared setting or narrator fixation.
  - **Key anchors:** “Chine”; boy tumbling into sea; ruined lighthouse.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** setting markers later place these pages in distinct, incompatible locations or show “sea” is figurative.

- **Cluster:** Bells and summoning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
  - **Rationale:** Prominent bell/bell-wire focus; household-service dynamics and anxiety.
  - **Key anchors:** dangling bell-wire (Speckled Band echo); bell “as of a boding gnat”; “time was not unlimited”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** bell references resolve to unrelated settings with no shared voice/tells.

- **Cluster:** Detective/legal self-fashioning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md
  - **Rationale:** Sherlock/detective framing + investigation/judgement language + literary allusion density.
  - **Key anchors:** Speckled Band; Baker Street; “investigator/judge” motif.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages clearly separate narrators/contexts for these allusions.

- **Cluster:** Mid-August calendar hints (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 19’s “Human Comedy… beyond to-day” strongly suggests Balzac’s death date, aligning with Page 8’s Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”; Page 10 supplies nearby “Hyacinth’s day / Jasmine’s day” with an explicit 2‑day offset.
  - **Key anchors:** Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”; “Human Comedy” “to-day”; Hyacinth/Jasmine day-names + “went back two days”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** dates don’t align when verified, or “day” terms are private nicknames rather than calendar anchors.

- **Cluster:** Mr. Hall + knob mechanism (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages feature “twiddling” a (black/polished) knob followed by Mr. Hall entering; suggests the same scene/device.
  - **Key anchors:** repeated Mr. Hall entrances; knob described as black/red vs polished.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show multiple unrelated Mr. Hall contexts or different mechanisms.

- **Cluster:** Wills and inheritance (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md
  - **Rationale:** Pages 12/14 centre wills/“leave everything” talk; Page 28 adds a “forging” scheme while “the woman was not yet dead”, suggesting the same general plot/motif.
  - **Key anchors:** documents + “abstracted will”; overheard “leave everything to me… May”; “Forging ahead… since the woman was not yet dead.”
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are unrelated conversations (different May/setting).

- **Cluster:** Nautical timekeeping register (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md
  - **Rationale:** Sea setting + sailor diction; Page 11 has capstan + dog-watch time marker.
  - **Key anchors:** sea/gulls/“sailor” cues; capstan bar; “second dog” watch.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “capstan”/“dog” language is shown to be metaphorical/non-nautical.

- **Cluster:** Plant/poison thread (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated botanical poison language (foxgloves/digitalis, calabar/physostigma, hellebore, lobelia, “lords and ladies”, gardenia taxonomy) suggests a shared narrator expertise or method thread.
  - **Key anchors:** “foxgloves” / “digitalis purpurea”; “Calabar Bean” / “physostigma” / “old Calabar”; “hellebore”; lobelia + “lords and ladies”; Cape Jasmine/gardenia precision; beans/pill + potato leaves.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are isolated metaphors with no shared voice/continuity.

- **Cluster:** Animal POV (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md
  - **Rationale:** Explicit animal-coded reactions (ears pulled, “low noise”; tail “vibration” clue; mating/banishment behaviour) point to non-human narrator segments.
  - **Key anchors:** pulled ears + low noise; “no vibration… of my latter end”; “lowered myself and made love”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later context shows these are human metaphors (or the POV is clearly human).

- **Cluster:** Clement name clue (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 24 explicitly frames a name shared by “fourteen popes and two anti-popes” and mentions Giulio de Medici (Clement VII), aligning with the character name Clement on Page 3; Page 27 recalls “tiny Clem”; Page 32 has Henry meeting with “Clément” yesterday.
  - **Key anchors:** pope-count clue + Giulio de Medici; Page 3’s “meeting with Clement”; Page 27’s “tiny Clem”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 24 narrator is explicitly named something else later, or “Clement” is purely thematic.

- **Cluster:** Debts and bills (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated debt/bill language suggests a continuity hook or blackmail/payoff thread.
  - **Key anchors:** “I always pay my debts” label; “Bills should always be met squarely”; “valuable services rendered”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show the phrasing is purely proverbial and does not recur or connect to the will/forgery thread.
