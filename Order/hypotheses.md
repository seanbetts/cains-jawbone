- **Cluster:** (short label)
  - **Pages:**  
  - **Rationale:**

  - **Disconfirming evidence:** (what would falsify this cluster)  
  - **Next falsification check:** (next concrete test to run)  

### Phase 3 narrator clusters (current focus)

Clusters prefixed with `Nxx` map to `Indexes/narrators.md`. Overlap is allowed; **do not add within-cluster sequencing in Phase 3**.

- **Cluster:** `N01` Aquarius pen / “Ecky” bar voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Rationale:** Pen/hand/income fixation + astrology wordplay + “Dawn/Moon” venue language suggest a consistent narrator signature.
  - **Key anchors:** “mottled black and silver Aquarius”; “ruin my hand”; desserts/cocktails treated as titled items; “the Dawn”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Alexander (“Ecky”) is later shown to be a different POV than the Aquarius-pen narrator, or “bad for the hand” is a widely shared motif across voices.

- **Cluster:** `N12` Calabar/digitalis poison-logistics + murder-as-genre voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md)
  - **Rationale:** Shared poison anchors (Calabar/digitalis) and a consistent practical, darkly comic “murder mechanics” register (counts, pursuit set-pieces, try-again planning) suggest a stable narrator signature.
  - **Key anchors:** Calabar bean/physostigma; digitalis; murder-counting language; “Murders were funny things”; “give him another day”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Calabar/digitalis references recur widely across unrelated voices, or the pursuit/murder-count tone is shown to be a separate narrator from the poison-logistics pages.

- **Cluster:** `N13` Host/guest poisoning + coastal-house segment (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md)
  - **Rationale:** Pages 86–87 share a continuous host/guest/patient poisoning frame with Yeats/Whitman quotations and a distinctive coastal-house setting; this reads as a coherent narrator segment.
  - **Key anchors:** Caroline Jasmine; Mithradates inoculation; Yeats “bent low and low…” continuation; bay landscape → corpse imagery.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the apparent continuation is later shown to be coincidental (e.g., cut-and-paste echo) with incompatible settings/participants.

- **Cluster:** `N15` “Green” victim + Compact syringe (first killing) voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md
  - **Rationale:** A consistent self-justifying voice frames a named target (Green) and an explicitly admitted “first” killing, with a specific method/tool cue (Compact hypodermic) and a shared date-anchor habit (Perceval).
  - **Key anchors:** victim named Green; “it was my first”; “Compact” syringe; Spencer Perceval assassination reference.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “my first” is non-lethal, or Green/Perceval anchors resolve as unrelated allusions in different voices.

- **Cluster:** `N16` St. Bruno / smell-memory + incinerator-evidence voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md
  - **Rationale:** A consistent narrator signature uses smell/odour as an organising device (including synaesthetic metaphors), with self-aware narration and abrupt associative pivots; Pages 44–45 add Henry-focused “problem/evidence” detail to the same sensory-first register.
  - **Key anchors:** “Smells meant a lot to me”; “Jew’s lime… concomitant odour”; “first St. Bruno”; Vera Cruz fonda memory; half-burned marriage certificate in an incinerator; medlar+vine “two notes of a chord” (venetian red/peridot).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 7 or Page 55 is later shown to be a different narrator/scene using smell imagery incidentally, or the Henry/Hodge anchors in Pages 44–45 are proven to belong to a separate voice from the smell-synaesthesia register.

- **Cluster:** `N17` Dog-watch/capstan + Kipling-quoting punster voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
  - **Rationale:** A shared nautical timekeeping register (dog-watch/capstan) and heavy Kipling embedding, alongside punny London geography, suggests a consistent narrator signature.
  - **Key anchors:** dog-watch time marker; capstan bar; Kipling’s “The Mary Gloster”; Selfridges/Bond Street wordplay; Swift/De Quincey name-drops.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the shared nautical/Kipling anchors are shown to be generic motifs reused across unrelated narrators.

- **Cluster:** `N18` Diary/verify + falser-hand forgery voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 78’s narrator voice is tightly anchored by explicit falsifiability framing and document/handwriting manipulation language.
  - **Key anchors:** “verify… I never travel without my diary”; “mimic artistry”; “falser hand”; “new instrument”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “diary/verify” language appears elsewhere in an unmistakably different voice, or Page 78 is later shown to be quoting another speaker rather than the narrator.

- **Cluster:** `N19` Comic coastal punster (buttonholes/lighthouse/brand riffs) (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages use a rapid-fire punning, brand-name riffing voice and share coastal danger markers (sea/lighthouse) while positioning Henry as a colourful centre of attention.
  - **Key anchors:** buttonhole scene behind the church; boy about to tumble into the sea; ruined lighthouse; “Emperor’s Peg” + vitriol/applejack; Bisto/Cerebos riffing; O.M./M.O./OM wordplay.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 5’s narrator voice proves incompatible with Page 4’s (different social position/setting with no shared tells beyond generic puns).

- **Cluster:** `N20` Bloomsbury/nomenclature + grim-scene voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages foreground classed self-consciousness and wordplay about naming, framed against grim bodily/violent contexts and “reckon with Henry” pressure.
  - **Key anchors:** “Bloomsbury”; “Newdigate fringe”; “nomenclature business”; “Caseus, ah!”; hand dropping to hip pocket.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the naming/wordplay is shown to be incidental, or the scenes are later explicitly narrated by different named speakers.

- **Cluster:** `N21` Dazed infatuation + bar/tea imagery voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md
  - **Rationale:** A recurring narrator signature combines self-described dazedness with sensual fixation on surfaces/hair and a social drink/tea register, with Henry repeatedly serving as the axis of fascination or correction.
  - **Key anchors:** “electrically aware” bar presence; cocktail after cocktail + cigarette; Babs copper hair + first rain; “I always feel a bit dazed”; Henry policing diction (“got me”); Browning “Saul” excerpt + “what Henry would think of next” anticipation.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** these are shown to be separate narrators sharing only general “sensual description” tropes.

- **Cluster:** `N22` Morbid London decoder (plague quotation voice) (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 2 combines a distinctive “figures and letters” decoding finish line with a sepulchral London observation filtered through an embedded plague quotation.
  - **Key anchors:** “figures and letters swam”; “There were no more”; plague prose snippets + “writer had strangely died to-day.”
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the plague quotation and decoding framing recur as generic motifs across unrelated narrators.

- **Cluster:** `N23` Music-hall cosmetics / Highgate Empire voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md
  - **Rationale:** A distinctive theatre/cosmetics vignette voice (false eyebrows, make-up artist, Highgate Empire) stands apart from other Henry-linked scenes.
  - **Key anchors:** Highgate Empire; Russian ballet; false eyebrows in clear soup; “man who made up”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show this is a quoted anecdote recounted by multiple narrators with different voices.

- **Cluster:** `N24` Scotland Yard collapse / Kursaal voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 100’s narrator is physically incapacitated and frames a collapse scene via Scotland Yard and specific Southend Kursaal geography, with a gloating antagonist and a valedictory “Good-bye, Henry.”
  - **Key anchors:** Scotland Yard; Woolworth’s; Kursaal; buttonhole motif; “how ill… about my heart”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the collapse frame is purely rhetorical or the Scotland Yard/Kursaal layer is reused by other narrators.

- **Cluster:** `N25` Quicksands-of-crime interviewer / papers voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md)
  - **Rationale:** Page 34’s “ironic comment” and “innocent child” moralising register matches Page 52’s crime/innocence rhetoric; Pages 52–53 then supply the same voice in a concrete “interview/papers” scene culminating in a contemptuous introduction of Sir Paul Trinder.
  - **Key anchors:** “ironic comment”; “innocent child”; “end of my interview”; “make yourself comfortable with the papers”; “commentary… page after page”; “introduced to me”; “well-fed swine”; Westphalian ham.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Westphalian ham/papers language is shown to be a widely reused table-setting motif, or the “introduced to me” Trinder description is later anchored to a different narrator/setting.

- **Cluster:** `N26` “Awful and literal sense” breakfast-recapping / second-sight voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages share the distinctive parenthetical aside “in the awful and literal sense of the word” and a morning/breakfast framing that mixes self-mocking wordplay with heightened mental-state reporting (recapitulation/second-sight).
  - **Key anchors:** repeated “awful and literal sense” phrasing; breakfast setting (toast/marmalade; sausage); insomnia + “agony of recapitulation”; “Clare” (clairvoyant/clairaudient pun).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the shared aside is shown to be a common quotation reused across multiple voices, or the surrounding diction/register proves incompatible beyond the single repeated phrase.

- **Cluster:** `N27` Peebles mineralogy lecturer / bell-summoning voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 9’s narrator is sharply characterised by a snobbish servant-bell frame and a specific academic self-positioning (mineralogy lectures at “Peebles University” with assistant Charles Day), plus an explicit Day/Knight pun.
  - **Key anchors:** “sound of the bell”; “lower orders”; “lectures on mineralogy at Peebles University”; “assistant Charles Day”; “Day… Knight cometh”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the Peebles/mineralogy identity is later shown to belong to a different narrator, or the scene is revealed as a quoted anecdote.

- **Cluster:** `N04` Great Lexicographer / fealty voice (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages use the distinctive “Great Lexicographer” anchor and similar learned, punning diction; fealty/reading-aloud framing suggests a consistent narrator segment.
  - **Key anchors:** “Great Lexicographer”; Ockham’s razor joke; McLeod of that ilk; Bellerophon letters / bait/hook metaphor.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show different narrators/settings using “Great Lexicographer” independently, or the McLeod/Johnson linkage is disproved.

- **Cluster:** Menu-title sweets (Lover’s Delight/Banana Split/Rainbow) (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated named desserts and explicit sundae rules (including Lent) suggest either shared venue/menu continuity or a deliberately reused motif across voices (e.g., `N01`/`N12`/`N14`).
  - **Key anchors:** “Lover’s Delight”; Banana Split; “Rainbow”; Lent “second Sundae” constraint.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later context shows the terms are generic one-off jokes with no recurrence or shared setting.

- **Cluster:** `N14` Babbie / Rainbow Sundae / hair-and-allusion voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md
  - **Rationale:** A distinctive infatuated, performatively learned voice combines French verse with dessert-order rules and an obsession with attributing writers, while observing Henry being “tried out” (cap on/off).
  - **Key anchors:** Babbie’s hair fixation; Baudelaire “La Chevelure”; “Rainbow” + Lent “second Sundae” rule; “I have always hated that these writers should be anonymous.”
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show the same motifs used casually by multiple unrelated narrators, or Page 63’s Henry is proven to be a different referent (not the recurring character-name).

- **Cluster:** `N05` School nostalgia + chapel (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md
  - **Rationale:** All three pages share a school/chapel setting with a remembered Head and institutional details, plus a consistent nostalgia/allusion-heavy voice (allowing for a possible pivot on Page 68).
  - **Key anchors:** fives courts; old Hall hung with Beardsley/Rops; “the Head”; Latham Chapel fire in 1906; “darling young” leaving.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later evidence shows Latham Chapel refers to a different institution than the Hall/fives-courts memories.

- **Cluster:** `N09` “Old man” slow-death / letter-blackmail voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
  - **Rationale:** A recurring narrator signature links paranoia about an “old man” and a “crucial meeting” (with suspected eavesdropping) to an explicitly witnessed slow death and then to letter/retaliation anxiety.
  - **Key anchors:** “old man”; “done slowly to death”; franked item to “the girl”; threat “do me in”; London landmarks (Eros / Queen’s Hall) amid fear-driven associative wordplay.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “done slowly to death” is figurative, or the “he”/retaliation target in Page 70 is clearly not the same “old man” context as Pages 68–69.

- **Cluster:** `N07` Bunny and Perry (Pro/Con) mental debate (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages personify internal argument as “Bunny and Perry” going at it “hammer and tongs”, with tennis/venue imagery.
  - **Key anchors:** “Bunny and Perry”; “hammer and tongs”; explicit tennis/venue shifts.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later context shows “Bunny and Perry” refers to external people rather than an internal debate trope.

- **Cluster:** `N08` King (“Kipling” name-jibe) narrator (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md)
  - **Rationale:** Pages 85 and 94 share a narrator-name clue (schoolboy “Kipling” jibe → King; narrator sees own name in a window-sign) and a recurring Henry-in-scene frame; additional detective/police allusions suggest nearby overlap with other Henry/detection pages.
  - **Key anchors:** “Kipling” as a name-jibe; narrator seeing their own name printed in a window; Baker Street / detective framing.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the name clue resolves differently, or the window-sign name refers to someone/something other than the narrator.

- **Cluster:** `N06` Orator/artist + flowers/documents/OGPU voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md)
  - **Rationale:** Pages 73, 74, and 75 mix art/oratory identity, French verse, and a secrecy/blackmail register; Pages 75 and 83 continue the flower/rose fixation and eyesight/“documents” concerns.
  - **Key anchors:** May/red-May scent; red/white roses + marigolds/calendula; red rose “sole survivor”; “orange tinted documents”; Goya reproduction confusion; “Will anyone know about them?”; Leningrad/OGPU mention; flower-seller interruption.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “May” resolves purely as the month/plant with no person continuity, or “them/documents” do not recur across pages.

- **Cluster:** Coastal imagery (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated sea-adjacent cues (Chine, tumbling into sea, lighthouse) suggest a shared setting or narrator fixation.
  - **Key anchors:** “Chine”; boy tumbling into sea; ruined lighthouse.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** setting markers later place these pages in distinct, incompatible locations or show “sea” is figurative.

- **Cluster:** Bells and summoning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
  - **Rationale:** Prominent bell/bell-wire focus; household-service dynamics and anxiety.
  - **Key anchors:** dangling bell-wire (Speckled Band echo); bell “as of a boding gnat”; “time was not unlimited”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** bell references resolve to unrelated settings with no shared voice/tells.

- **Cluster:** Detective/legal self-fashioning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Rationale:** Sherlock/detective framing + investigation/judgement language + literary allusion density.
  - **Key anchors:** Speckled Band; Baker Street; Scotland Yard; “investigator/judge” motif; “thank goodness, I was no detective”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages clearly separate narrators/contexts for these allusions.

- **Cluster:** `N11` De’Ath (“Black Museum”) narrator (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md)
  - **Rationale:** Page 91 contains a high-signal narrator self-identification (DEATH → De’Ath/DeAth) paired with a distinctive “Black Museum” crime-collection voice.
  - **Key anchors:** “Black Museum”; “capitalise my third letter” nameplay; macabre exhibit anecdote; “Smiler with the Knife”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the nameplay resolves to a different identity, or “Black Museum” is used generically with no stable narrator signature.

- **Cluster:** Mid-August calendar hints (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 19’s “Human Comedy… beyond to-day” strongly suggests Balzac’s death date, aligning with Page 8’s Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”; Page 10 supplies nearby “Hyacinth’s day / Jasmine’s day” with an explicit 2‑day offset.
  - **Key anchors:** Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”; “Human Comedy” “to-day”; Hyacinth/Jasmine day-names + “went back two days”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** dates don’t align when verified, or “day” terms are private nicknames rather than calendar anchors.

- **Cluster:** Mr. Hall + knob mechanism (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages feature “twiddling” a (black/polished) knob followed by Mr. Hall entering; suggests the same scene/device.
  - **Key anchors:** repeated Mr. Hall entrances; knob described as black/red vs polished.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show multiple unrelated Mr. Hall contexts or different mechanisms.

- **Cluster:** `N10` Will/document eavesdropper voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md)
  - **Rationale:** Pages 12 and 14 share inheritance eavesdropping and legal/document language (including a May-addressed “leave everything to me” frame), suggesting a possible consistent narrator signature around estate manoeuvring.
  - **Key anchors:** will/inheritance talk addressed to May; “abstracted will” pun; document-reading setup.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** May/Henry context proves incompatible across the two pages, or the will language is a one-off motif rather than a narrator signature.

- **Cluster:** Wills and inheritance (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md
  - **Rationale:** Pages 12/14 centre wills/“leave everything” talk; Page 28 adds a “forging” scheme while “the woman was not yet dead”; Page 50 explicitly says “The will was there” with a man working over “strange pens”; Page 78 describes “mimic artistry” and a “soon to be dead woman’s” memorial being guided by a “falser hand”.
  - **Key anchors:** documents + “abstracted will”; overheard “leave everything to me… May”; “Forging ahead… since the woman was not yet dead”; Page 50’s caseful of pens + will-at-table scene.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are unrelated conversations (different May/setting).

- **Cluster:** Nautical timekeeping register (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
  - **Rationale:** Sea setting + sailor diction; Page 11 has capstan + dog-watch time marker; Page 41 mentions “first dog” (possibly dog-watch).
  - **Key anchors:** sea/gulls/“sailor” cues; capstan bar; “second dog” watch; “first dog”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “capstan”/“dog” language is shown to be metaphorical/non-nautical.

- **Cluster:** Cocktail-bar seduction (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages foreground a woman in a drinking/seduction setting, with strong sensory fixation and menu/venue vocabulary (“the Dawn”; named desserts/drinks).
  - **Key anchors:** “cocktail after cocktail”; cigarette; “the Dawn”; “Lover’s Delight” / Banana Split; Henry guiding narrator (Page 42); Alexander (“Ecky”) narrator voice (Page 43).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are separate narrators/venues and the drink/dessert titles do not recur together.

- **Cluster:** Westphalian ham + paper-reading (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages use Westphalian ham as a table-setting while someone handles/reads “papers/bits of paper”, suggesting a shared interview or clue-reading scene.
  - **Key anchors:** Westphalian ham; “papers” / “bits of paper”; shared table/companionship.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Westphalian ham is merely decorative and appears across unrelated scenes with no consistent narrator/setting.

- **Cluster:** Whitman quotations (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_51.md
  - **Rationale:** Multiple explicit Whitman snippets suggest a shared narrator reading set or a deliberate “Whitman voice” cluster.
  - **Key anchors:** Page 32’s Whitman “good fortune” quote + scansion talk; Page 51’s “I dance with the dancers…” and other Whitman lines.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Whitman lines appear scattered across many unrelated narrators without other shared tells.

- **Cluster:** Plant/poison thread (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated botanical poison language (foxgloves/digitalis, calabar/physostigma, hellebore, lobelia, “lords and ladies”, gardenia taxonomy) suggests a shared narrator expertise or method thread.
  - **Key anchors:** “foxgloves” / “digitalis purpurea”; “Calabar Bean” / “physostigma” / “old Calabar”; “hellebore”; lobelia + “lords and ladies”; Cape Jasmine/gardenia precision; beans/pill + potato leaves; Page 54’s “pestle a poisoned poison” + “green blood” horticulture; Page 59’s gelsemium (yellow jasmine).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are isolated metaphors with no shared voice/continuity.

- **Cluster:** “To-day” as historical date marker (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md
  - **Rationale:** Each page ties “to-day” to a specific historical event/holiday (diamond necklace acquittal; Waterloo/La Belle Alliance; a “fifth” deliverance holiday), suggesting calendar-key ordering mechanics.
  - **Key anchors:** Diamond Necklace cardinal acquittal; “meeting at La Belle Alliance”; “James… the Earl and his brother Alexander”; Francis Ferdinand’s murder reference.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “to-day” references are purely decorative and do not resolve to dates or ordering constraints.

- **Cluster:** `N02` Dog POV (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Rationale:** Explicit animal-coded reactions (ears pulled, “low noise”; tail “vibration” clue; mating/banishment behaviour) plus dog-coded details (chop; “nose” perspective) point to non-human narrator segments.
  - **Key anchors:** pulled ears + low noise; “no vibration… of my latter end”; “lowered myself and made love”; “provided a chop for me”; “nearly fell on my nose”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later context shows these are human metaphors (or the POV is clearly human).

- **Cluster:** `N03` Clement / pills / flowers-and-mercy register (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 24 explicitly frames a name shared by “fourteen popes and two anti-popes” and mentions Giulio de Medici (Clement VII), aligning with the character name Clement on Page 3; Page 27 recalls “tiny Clem”; Page 32 has Henry meeting with “Clément” yesterday.
  - **Key anchors:** pope-count clue + Giulio de Medici; Page 3’s “meeting with Clement”; Page 27’s “tiny Clem”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 24 narrator is explicitly named something else later, or “Clement” is purely thematic.

- **Cluster:** Debts and bills (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated debt/bill language suggests a continuity hook or blackmail/payoff thread.
  - **Key anchors:** “I always pay my debts” label; “Bills should always be met squarely”; “valuable services rendered”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show the phrasing is purely proverbial and does not recur or connect to the will/forgery thread.

## Candidate sequences

Phase 3 note: sequencing work is deferred (Phase 4+). Keep this section as a historical scratchpad only; do not extend it during clustering.

Template:

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN/LIKELY/MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_?.md → …`
  - **Why:**  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:**  
  - **Next falsification check:**  

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md`
  - **Why:** Direct sentence continuation across the page break (“hung round with … the darker works…”).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Only if a transcription artifact is discovered (unlikely given page integrity checks).

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md`
  - **Why:** Direct sentence continuation across the page break (“hung round with photographs…”).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Only if a transcription artifact is discovered (unlikely given page integrity checks).

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md`
  - **Why:** Direct continuation of a quotation split across the page break (“…kissed the quiet feet / Of the old bold mate…”).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Only if the quotation appears elsewhere uninterrupted (making the break coincidental).

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md`
  - **Why:** Page 74’s secrecy about “them” (bought in Leningrad from an OGPU-linked seller) plausibly links to Page 75’s unreadable “orange tinted documents”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Them” refers to something other than documents and no shared objects/references recur.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md`
  - **Why:** Page 76 frames a named victim (“Green”) and the need to “do the thing” personally; Page 77 immediately reflects on committing a first killing.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Green” is not an in-world victim, or Page 77’s “my first” refers to something non-lethal/unrelated.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md`
  - **Why:** Both are table scenes with Henry present and a nearby dog; Page 82’s disorientation could precede Page 85’s “weary business… ended” closure.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** settings or Henry’s role clearly diverge, or another page bridges the continuity.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md`
  - **Why:** Shared “old man” thread (crucial meeting → slow death witnessed → letter/retaliation fear) suggests narrative continuity.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “old man” is generic or the pronoun targets differ across pages.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md`
  - **Why:** Both pages centre an “old gentleman” figure within a hunting/food register (deer/collops; deer-stalker) in a refined venue context.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** The two old-gentleman figures are distinct, or the settings differ (moor/outdoors vs indoor soigné venue) with no bridging continuity.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md`
  - **Why:** Page 52 sets up an interview-with-papers framed as “commentary… page after page”; Page 53 continues with an “introduced to me” subject (Sir Paul Trinder) in drink, consistent with a run of interview pages.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the “man who entered” on Page 52 is clearly a different person/context from Sir Paul Trinder, with no sustained interview continuity.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md`
  - **Why:** Trinder appears in the interview sequence (Page 53), is “about” during a gelsemium/poisoning context (Page 59), and a bearded pseudo-scientist target is declared dead after a planned “Lover’s Delight” setup (Page 60).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 59’s “Trinder” and Page 60’s “figurehead beard” refer to different people, or the scenes’ settings/mechanics don’t align.
