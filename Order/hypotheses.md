# Ordering hypotheses

Record clusters and candidate sequences with reasons and falsifiers.

## Clusters

Template:

- **Cluster:** (short label)
  - **Pages:**  
  - **Rationale:**  
  - **Key anchors:** (quotes, motifs, time/place)  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** (what would falsify this cluster)  

- **Cluster:** Henry name occurrences (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md
  - **Rationale:** “Henry” appears across multiple scenes with shifting roles; may be one person or multiple people sharing the name.
  - **Key anchors:** “Lesurques” (Courier of Lyons?) role reference; ruined lighthouse + “Emperor’s Peg”; capstan-bar / dog-watch nautical register; Henry stooping/cleaning and handling bodies; Page 21’s “latest victim” + blood; Page 26’s “first two killings” + companion/rector’s aunt; Page 35’s police manhunt; Page 36’s buried corpse detail + “made up”; Pages 41–45 marriage/murder framing (certificate/corpse); Pages 47/49 attraction + “doomed to destroy… for family reasons”; Page 58’s “third/fourth” victims; Page 60’s “peerless investigator” role.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages give different surnames/biographical details for each “Henry”, or show mutually exclusive locations/timelines.

- **Cluster:** Great Lexicographer voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages use the distinctive “Great Lexicographer” anchor and similar learned, punning diction; fealty/reading-aloud framing suggests a consistent narrator segment.
  - **Key anchors:** “Great Lexicographer”; Ockham’s razor joke; McLeod of that ilk; Bellerophon letters / bait/hook metaphor.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show different narrators/settings using “Great Lexicographer” independently, or the McLeod/Johnson linkage is disproved.

- **Cluster:** Sundaes + named sweets (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated named desserts and talk of sundaes (“Lover’s Delight”, Banana Split, “Rainbow”, Lent rule) suggests venue/menu continuity or a narrator fixation.
  - **Key anchors:** “Lover’s Delight” sundae; Banana Split; “Rainbow”; Lent constraint on sundaes; recurring “Henry” mention in the same cluster.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later context shows these are isolated jokes with no shared setting/characters.

- **Cluster:** School nostalgia + chapel (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md
  - **Rationale:** Pages 66–67 are continuous text and all three pages share a school/chapel setting with a remembered Head and institutional details.
  - **Key anchors:** fives courts; old Hall hung with Beardsley/Rops; “the Head”; Latham Chapel fire in 1906; “darling young” leaving.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later evidence shows Latham Chapel refers to a different institution than the Hall/fives-courts memories.

- **Cluster:** Old man slow-death thread (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
  - **Rationale:** “Old man” appears as a key node (crucial meeting → witnessed slow death) followed by letter/retaliation anxiety.
  - **Key anchors:** “old man”; “done slowly to death”; franked item to “the girl”; threat “do me in”; “old association” (arthritic knee anecdote).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “done slowly to death” is figurative, or the “he” in Page 70 is not the same as the “old man” in Pages 68–69.

- **Cluster:** Flowers + documents + failing eyesight (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md
  - **Rationale:** Multiple pages combine courtship-by-flowers, secrecy around “them”/documents, and vision failure (blurred art; inability to read).
  - **Key anchors:** May/red-May scent; red/white roses + marigolds/calendula; “orange tinted documents”; Goya reproduction confusion; “Will anyone know about them?”; Leningrad/OGPU mention.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “May” resolves purely as the month/plant with no person continuity, or “them/documents” do not recur across pages.

- **Cluster:** Coastal imagery (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated sea-adjacent cues (Chine, tumbling into sea, lighthouse) suggest a shared setting or narrator fixation.
  - **Key anchors:** “Chine”; boy tumbling into sea; ruined lighthouse.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** setting markers later place these pages in distinct, incompatible locations or show “sea” is figurative.

- **Cluster:** Bells and summoning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
  - **Rationale:** Prominent bell/bell-wire focus; household-service dynamics and anxiety.
  - **Key anchors:** dangling bell-wire (Speckled Band echo); bell “as of a boding gnat”; “time was not unlimited”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** bell references resolve to unrelated settings with no shared voice/tells.

- **Cluster:** Detective/legal self-fashioning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md
  - **Rationale:** Sherlock/detective framing + investigation/judgement language + literary allusion density.
  - **Key anchors:** Speckled Band; Baker Street; “investigator/judge” motif.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages clearly separate narrators/contexts for these allusions.

- **Cluster:** Mid-August calendar hints (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 19’s “Human Comedy… beyond to-day” strongly suggests Balzac’s death date, aligning with Page 8’s Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”; Page 10 supplies nearby “Hyacinth’s day / Jasmine’s day” with an explicit 2‑day offset.
  - **Key anchors:** Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”; “Human Comedy” “to-day”; Hyacinth/Jasmine day-names + “went back two days”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** dates don’t align when verified, or “day” terms are private nicknames rather than calendar anchors.

- **Cluster:** Mr. Hall + knob mechanism (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages feature “twiddling” a (black/polished) knob followed by Mr. Hall entering; suggests the same scene/device.
  - **Key anchors:** repeated Mr. Hall entrances; knob described as black/red vs polished.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show multiple unrelated Mr. Hall contexts or different mechanisms.

- **Cluster:** Wills and inheritance (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md
  - **Rationale:** Pages 12/14 centre wills/“leave everything” talk; Page 28 adds a “forging” scheme while “the woman was not yet dead”; Page 50 explicitly says “The will was there” with a man working over “strange pens”.
  - **Key anchors:** documents + “abstracted will”; overheard “leave everything to me… May”; “Forging ahead… since the woman was not yet dead”; Page 50’s caseful of pens + will-at-table scene.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are unrelated conversations (different May/setting).

- **Cluster:** Nautical timekeeping register (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
  - **Rationale:** Sea setting + sailor diction; Page 11 has capstan + dog-watch time marker; Page 41 mentions “first dog” (possibly dog-watch).
  - **Key anchors:** sea/gulls/“sailor” cues; capstan bar; “second dog” watch; “first dog”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “capstan”/“dog” language is shown to be metaphorical/non-nautical.

- **Cluster:** Cocktail-bar seduction (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
  - **Rationale:** Pages 42–43 foreground a woman in a drinking setting with drink/dessert titles; Page 60 orders a “Lover’s Delight” sundae, suggesting the same menu/venue vocabulary may recur.
  - **Key anchors:** “cocktail after cocktail”; cigarette; “Lover’s Delight” / “Banana Split” / “the Dawn”; Henry guiding narrator (Page 42); Alexander (“Ecky”) narrator voice (Page 43); Page 60’s “Lover’s Delight” sundae.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are separate narrators/venues and the drink/dessert titles do not recur together.

- **Cluster:** Westphalian ham + paper-reading (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages use Westphalian ham as a table-setting while someone handles/reads “papers/bits of paper”, suggesting a shared interview or clue-reading scene.
  - **Key anchors:** Westphalian ham; “papers” / “bits of paper”; shared table/companionship.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Westphalian ham is merely decorative and appears across unrelated scenes with no consistent narrator/setting.

- **Cluster:** Whitman quotations (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_51.md
  - **Rationale:** Multiple explicit Whitman snippets suggest a shared narrator reading set or a deliberate “Whitman voice” cluster.
  - **Key anchors:** Page 32’s Whitman “good fortune” quote + scansion talk; Page 51’s “I dance with the dancers…” and other Whitman lines.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Whitman lines appear scattered across many unrelated narrators without other shared tells.

- **Cluster:** Plant/poison thread (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated botanical poison language (foxgloves/digitalis, calabar/physostigma, hellebore, lobelia, “lords and ladies”, gardenia taxonomy) suggests a shared narrator expertise or method thread.
  - **Key anchors:** “foxgloves” / “digitalis purpurea”; “Calabar Bean” / “physostigma” / “old Calabar”; “hellebore”; lobelia + “lords and ladies”; Cape Jasmine/gardenia precision; beans/pill + potato leaves; Page 54’s “pestle a poisoned poison” + “green blood” horticulture; Page 59’s gelsemium (yellow jasmine).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are isolated metaphors with no shared voice/continuity.

- **Cluster:** “To-day” as historical date marker (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
  - **Rationale:** Each page ties “to-day” to a specific historical event/holiday (diamond necklace acquittal; Waterloo/La Belle Alliance; a “fifth” deliverance holiday), suggesting calendar-key ordering mechanics.
  - **Key anchors:** Diamond Necklace cardinal acquittal; “meeting at La Belle Alliance”; “James… the Earl and his brother Alexander”; Francis Ferdinand’s murder reference.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “to-day” references are purely decorative and do not resolve to dates or ordering constraints.

- **Cluster:** Animal POV (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md
  - **Rationale:** Explicit animal-coded reactions (ears pulled, “low noise”; tail “vibration” clue; mating/banishment behaviour) plus dog-coded details (chop; “nose” perspective) point to non-human narrator segments.
  - **Key anchors:** pulled ears + low noise; “no vibration… of my latter end”; “lowered myself and made love”; “provided a chop for me”; “nearly fell on my nose”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later context shows these are human metaphors (or the POV is clearly human).

- **Cluster:** Clement name clue (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 24 explicitly frames a name shared by “fourteen popes and two anti-popes” and mentions Giulio de Medici (Clement VII), aligning with the character name Clement on Page 3; Page 27 recalls “tiny Clem”; Page 32 has Henry meeting with “Clément” yesterday.
  - **Key anchors:** pope-count clue + Giulio de Medici; Page 3’s “meeting with Clement”; Page 27’s “tiny Clem”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 24 narrator is explicitly named something else later, or “Clement” is purely thematic.

- **Cluster:** Debts and bills (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated debt/bill language suggests a continuity hook or blackmail/payoff thread.
  - **Key anchors:** “I always pay my debts” label; “Bills should always be met squarely”; “valuable services rendered”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show the phrasing is purely proverbial and does not recur or connect to the will/forgery thread.

## Candidate sequences

Template:

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN/LIKELY/MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_?.md → …`
  - **Why:**  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:**  

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md`
  - **Why:** Direct sentence continuation across the page break (“hung round with … the darker works…”).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Only if a transcription artifact is discovered (unlikely given page integrity checks).

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md`
  - **Why:** Direct sentence continuation across the page break (“hung round with photographs…”).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Only if a transcription artifact is discovered (unlikely given page integrity checks).

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md`
  - **Why:** Page 74’s secrecy about “them” (bought in Leningrad from an OGPU-linked seller) plausibly links to Page 75’s unreadable “orange tinted documents”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Them” refers to something other than documents and no shared objects/references recur.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md`
  - **Why:** Shared “old man” thread (crucial meeting → slow death witnessed → letter/retaliation fear) suggests narrative continuity.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “old man” is generic or the pronoun targets differ across pages.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md`
  - **Why:** Page 52 sets up an interview-with-papers framed as “commentary… page after page”; Page 53 continues with an “introduced to me” subject (Sir Paul Trinder) in drink, consistent with a run of interview pages.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the “man who entered” on Page 52 is clearly a different person/context from Sir Paul Trinder, with no sustained interview continuity.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md`
  - **Why:** Trinder appears in the interview sequence (Page 53), is “about” during a gelsemium/poisoning context (Page 59), and a bearded pseudo-scientist target is declared dead after a planned “Lover’s Delight” setup (Page 60).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 59’s “Trinder” and Page 60’s “figurehead beard” refer to different people, or the scenes’ settings/mechanics don’t align.
