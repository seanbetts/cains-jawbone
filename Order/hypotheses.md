# Ordering hypotheses

Record clusters and candidate sequences with reasons and falsifiers.

## Clusters

Template:

- **Cluster:** (short label)
  - **Pages:**  
  - **Rationale:**  
  - **Key anchors:** (quotes, motifs, time/place)  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** (what would falsify this cluster)  

- **Cluster:** Henry sightings (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Rationale:** Henry appears in multiple scenes; could be a continuity hook across narrators/settings.
  - **Key anchors:** actor reference (“Lesurques”); ruined lighthouse + “Emperor’s Peg”; social circle talking Browning.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages give different surnames/biographical details for “Henry” in each scene.

- **Cluster:** Coastal imagery (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated sea-adjacent cues (Chine, tumbling into sea, lighthouse) suggest a shared setting or narrator fixation.
  - **Key anchors:** “Chine”; boy tumbling into sea; ruined lighthouse.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** setting markers later place these pages in distinct, incompatible locations or show “sea” is figurative.

## Candidate sequences

Template:

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN/LIKELY/MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_?.md → …`
  - **Why:**  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:**
