# Ordering hypotheses

Record clusters and candidate sequences with reasons and falsifiers.

## Clusters

Template:

- **Cluster:** (short label)
  - **Pages:**  
  - **Rationale:**  
  - **Key anchors:** (quotes, motifs, time/place)  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** (what would falsify this cluster)  

- **Cluster:** Henry name occurrences (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md
  - **Rationale:** “Henry” appears across multiple scenes with shifting roles; may be one person or multiple people sharing the name.
  - **Key anchors:** “Lesurques” (Courier of Lyons?) role reference; ruined lighthouse + “Emperor’s Peg”; capstan-bar / dog-watch nautical register; Henry stooping/cleaning and handling bodies.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages give different surnames/biographical details for each “Henry”, or show mutually exclusive locations/timelines.

- **Cluster:** Coastal imagery (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated sea-adjacent cues (Chine, tumbling into sea, lighthouse) suggest a shared setting or narrator fixation.
  - **Key anchors:** “Chine”; boy tumbling into sea; ruined lighthouse.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** setting markers later place these pages in distinct, incompatible locations or show “sea” is figurative.

- **Cluster:** Bells and summoning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
  - **Rationale:** Prominent bell/bell-wire focus; household-service dynamics and anxiety.
  - **Key anchors:** dangling bell-wire (Speckled Band echo); bell “as of a boding gnat”; “time was not unlimited”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** bell references resolve to unrelated settings with no shared voice/tells.

- **Cluster:** Detective/legal self-fashioning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md
  - **Rationale:** Sherlock/detective framing + investigation/judgement language + literary allusion density.
  - **Key anchors:** Speckled Band; Baker Street; “investigator/judge” motif.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages clearly separate narrators/contexts for these allusions.

- **Cluster:** Mid-August calendar hints (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md
  - **Rationale:** “to-day” tied to historical deaths + “Hyacinth’s day / Jasmine’s day” with “went back two days” suggests a calendar-driven micro-sequence.
  - **Key anchors:** Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”; Hyacinth/Jasmine day-names + explicit offset.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** dates don’t align on verification, or “day” terms are private nicknames rather than calendar anchors.

- **Cluster:** Wills and inheritance (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages centre wills/“leave everything” talk; might be the same scene or a thematic narrator thread.
  - **Key anchors:** documents + “abstracted will”; overheard “leave everything to me… May”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are unrelated conversations (different May/setting).

- **Cluster:** Nautical timekeeping register (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md
  - **Rationale:** Sea setting + sailor diction; Page 11 has capstan + dog-watch time marker.
  - **Key anchors:** sea/gulls/“sailor” cues; capstan bar; “second dog” watch.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “capstan”/“dog” language is shown to be metaphorical/non-nautical.
