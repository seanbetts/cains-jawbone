# Ordering hypotheses

Record clusters and candidate sequences with reasons and falsifiers.

## Clusters

Template:

- **Cluster:** (short label)
  - **Pages:**  
  - **Rationale:**  
  - **Key anchors:** (quotes, motifs, time/place)  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** (what would falsify this cluster)  
  - **Next falsification check:** (next concrete test to run)  

### Phase 3 macro clusters (draft narrative strands)

These are **cross-narrator** groupings intended to reduce the search space for Phase 4. Overlap is allowed; **do not add within-cluster sequencing in Phase 3**.

- **Cluster:** Dog POV strand (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated non-human bodily perspective and dog-specific constraints are strong enough to treat these as a standalone narrative strand.
  - **Key anchors:** pulled ears + low noise; “no vibration… of my latter end”; “lowered myself and made love”; “provided a chop for me”; “my mistress” framing; Tate sugar hoarding.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - Currently identical to narrator cluster `N02` (treat as single-voice macro until falsified).
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (Dog POV):**
    - **Sequence A — date-anchored spine (Aug 12→18)** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md (MAYBE: Nahum Tate/BCP “to-day” = Aug 12) → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md (St Wigbert’s day = Aug 13) → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md (George Combe “last day” = Aug 14) → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md (Hyacinth’s day = Aug 16; “went back two days… bet”) → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md (“closing day in Potsdam” = Aug 17) → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md (Guido Reni + Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day” = Aug 18) → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md (“Human Comedy”/Balzac “to-day” = Aug 18).
      - **Why:**
        - Explicit calendar/saint-day anchors step forward across 88/39/10/99/8/19, with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md as a possible Aug 12 lead-in via the Tate/Book-of-Common-Prayer clue (drop Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md if that anchor fails).
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md’s “went back two days… bet” aligns cleanly with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md’s bet + Aug 14 Combe anchor.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md bow ends unequal + missing “jossers” → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md later “same bow… trimmed the left end”; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md share the call-bell/knob → Mr. Hall interruption motif.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md’s “last day” is shown to be a different historic/daybook anchor than Combe’s 14 Aug death-day.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md’s “went back two days” clearly refers to a different prior scene (not the Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md bet context).
        - The bow/“jossers” and Mr. Hall/knob motifs resolve to unrelated props/settings (coincidental repetition).
      - **Resolved check:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md’s Falkland/Queen-of-Bohemia hint is treated as an identification clue (Elizabeth Stuart) rather than a competing day-anchor, because the page’s explicit “to-day” allusion points to Balzac’s 18 Aug death-date; keep Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md in the Aug 18 group (after Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md).
      - **Resolved check:** the call-bell/knob + Mr. Hall interruption motif appears only on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md explicitly has Mr. Hall come in “again” after the knob is twiddled, making Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md the simplest continuity (first interruption, then again).
      - **Resolved check:** bow continuity is strong: “jossers” appears only on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md (ends unequal; he can’t find the “jossers” to fix it) and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md (“Later she was wearing the same bow… and that time he found them and trimmed the left end”), supporting Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md.
      - **Resolved check:** Dog POV “Jasmine” references on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md (explicit cat), Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md (“Tom… I killed in the matter of Jasmine”), Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md (“Tom and Flora’s Jasmine”), and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md (“remember her; she wasn’t the one I’d killed”) are **LIKELY** the same household cat (`P24`); keep Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md’s “Jasmine’s day” (`P14`) separate until it’s anchored.
      - **Resolved check:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md’s “Tom and Flora” most naturally names the same “he/she” couple being listened to (distemper-colour quarrel), and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md appears to show the same unnamed couple dynamic (Tate + “together too much”). However, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md’s Flora is LIKELY a dog mate (mating context + “colouring up”), so treat Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md’s Flora (`P101`) as **distinct** from Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md/Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md’s Flora (`P26`) unless a stronger cross-anchor appears.
      - **Resolved check:** corpus scan finds `Tom` only on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md (Tom vs tomcat/De Quincey ambiguity) and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md (the quarrelling couple), with no additional phrasing-level tie linking `P100`/`P101` to the dog‑mate Flora thread; keep them distinct for now.
    - **Sequence B — Flora subchain** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md.
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md’s “made love to Flora again” presupposes an earlier Flora encounter on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:** “again” on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md is shown to refer to a different earlier Flora encounter not present in this Dog POV set.
      - **Resolved check:** scan of the Dog POV set finds “Flora” only on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md (plus a possible name-use on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md); no earlier Flora reference found, so keep Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md.
    - **Sequence C — combined draft (stitch A+B; leaves p46 unplaced)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md.
      - **Unplaced:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md (Dec 14 “to-day” anchor; shares Jasmine/cat motif; see below).
      - **Why:**
        - Sequence A supplies a date-ordered spine; Sequence B locks Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md before Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md adds a candidate Aug 12 anchor (Nahum Tate/Book-of-Common-Prayer clue) and shares the Tate-sugar + “sick of the way they went on” motif with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md, supporting Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md’s “another Tate” reading is falsified (or “to-day” resolves to a different date) such that it cannot precede Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md’s Aug 13 anchor.
      - **Resolved check:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md’s “visited England to-day for the first time” is LIKELY a Chambers-*Book of Days* daybook hook for **Dec 14** (Albert, Prince Consort), so it does not currently integrate cleanly into the Aug 12→18 date spine.
      - **Resolved check:** scan of Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md finds no second Dec 14 (Albert/Prince Consort) hook beyond Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, so keep Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md separate from the Aug 12→18 chain and treat its placement as open.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** any page in this set is later shown to require an unambiguously human physical context (not idiom/metaphor).
  - **Resolved check:** POV audit found no unequivocal human-only physical situations in the core Dog POV pages; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md remains the weakest fit but is retained as a `MAYBE` extension within `N02`. Its “powerful glass” can be read as a naïve/figurative description (or as a lens used by “he” while the dog observes), and the same page contains dog-friendly cues (“sausage place… furtively I knew how excellent”) plus strong continuity anchors (bow/jossers; Mr. Hall bell-push) tying it into the strand.
  - **Resolved check:** date-spine audit confirms the Aug 13→18 anchors as independently corroborated (St. Wigbert Aug 13; Combe “last day” Aug 14 (LIKELY); St. Hyacinth Aug 16; Frederick II “closing day in Potsdam” Aug 17; Guido Reni + Kilmarnock/Balmerino Aug 18; Balzac Aug 18). Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md remains a candidate Aug 12 lead-in (drop if later contradicted).
  - **Falsifier:** a later page shows the narrator operating an optical instrument directly (hands/technique) in a way incompatible with Dog POV, forcing Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md to be treated as overlap-only rather than `N02`.

- **Cluster:** Botany/poison + gardening expertise strand (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md
  - **Rationale:** Dense, recurring plant/poison specificity (often tied to deliberate action) plus a repeated “competence/plan/instructions” register suggests either a shared narrator or a small set of closely linked narrators.
  - **Key anchors:** Calabar bean/physostigma; digitalis; hellebore; lobelia/Indian-tobacco; wild jasmine/roses; marigold/calendula; Mithradates inoculation; failing eyesight with “documents”; “job/instructions” framing.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N12` poison logistics: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md
    - `N03` Clement/pills/flowers: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md)
    - `N06` flowers/documents/OGPU: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md
    - `N13` host/guest poisoning: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md
    - Bridge singleton candidates: `N26` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md), `N31` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md)
    - Edge overlap promotions (low confidence): `N19` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md); `N16` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md)
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later evidence shows plant/poison talk is broadly distributed across unrelated voices with incompatible settings/participants.
  - **Next falsification check:** treat this as an umbrella and explicitly maintain sub-strands (`N12` poison logistics; `N03` Clement/mission plants; `N06` flowers+documents/OGPU; `N13` host/guest poisoning), only merging across them when a non-botanical phrase/participant anchor repeats; people-index suggests `P03` Clement anchors Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, `P16` May anchors Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md, and `P50` Sir Paul Trinder anchors Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md (potential bridge if Page 80 is confirmed in the host/guest poisoning sub-strand). Treat `P01` Henry as high-signal but high-noise (likely multiple Henrys across strands).

- **Cluster:** Paper artifacts + money pressure strand (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_18.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_72.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_98.md
  - **Rationale:** Multiple pages foreground documents/papers/letters (wills, interviews, “bits of paper”, magazines, signatures) tightly coupled to money pressure, leverage, or transaction-like scenes.
  - **Key anchors:** will/inheritance talk; forgery/handwriting manipulation; “papers” handled in an interview-like frame; “valuable services rendered”; franked letter/package to “the girl”; Café Royal time-budget + written account; “signatures were his business”; money changing hands “slowly” for later description.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** paper artifacts are shown to be a generic, widely used prop with no consistent voice/participant continuity (e.g., May/Henry clearly differ across all instances).
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - will/estate/forgery (`N10`/`N39`/`N18`): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md
    - interview/bills/papers (`N25`): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
    - old man/blackmail letters (`N09`): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
    - pen/handwriting (`N01`): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
    - lexicographer/letters/postman (`N04`): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md
    - singletons: rupee chapter (`N35`) (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_18.md); bills-in-the-paper/matches (`N40`) (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md); magazine meta (`N33`) (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_72.md); signatures/death-warrant talk (`N32`) (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md); medical-payoff meeting (`N38`) (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_98.md); Sunday paper anchor (`N17`) (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md); burned marriage certificate (`N16`) (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md); Defoe death-day decoding (`N22`) (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md)
  - **Next falsification check:** maintain the sub-strands above and only merge across them when a shared participant/object or repeated non-generic phrasing recurs; check for cross-sub-strand bridges via repeated participants (people-index suggests `P16` May in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_98.md; `P01` Henry in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md; and `P61` “poor old man” concentrated in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md) before merging.

- **Cluster:** Detective/police + violence scenes strand (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Rationale:** These pages share a crime/detection frame (explicitly or via detective canon allusions) and/or hands-on violence/corpse familiarity, often with London-police texture.
  - **Key anchors:** Sherlock/Mycroft and Sexton Blake; “Scotland Yard”; “Black Museum”; “Speckled Band” riff; window-throw vignette; “carnal, bloody and unnatural acts” frame.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N20` (Bloomsbury/nomenclature + grim-scene): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
    - `N08` (King narrator; Holmes/Blake + clock/transform habits): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
    - `N11` (De’Ath / “Black Museum”): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
    - `N24` (Scotland Yard collapse / Kursaal): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
    - `N28` (window-throw / “no detective”): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md
    - `N07` (proof/surveillance + pro/con reasoning): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md
    - `N15` (“Green” victim / murder contemplation): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md
    - `N16` (smell-memory + evidence destruction / corpse proximity): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** detective language resolves purely to decorative quotation collage and the surrounding voices/settings show no coherence.
  - **Next falsification check:** treat as an umbrella: keep the sub-strands above separate unless a shared participant/object or a repeated, non-generic phrasing ties them; people-index suggests `P99` (King narrator) anchors Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md, while `P01` Henry is widespread and should not be used as a sole bridge.

- **Cluster:** Aesthetic / infatuation / high-society strand (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_38.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_65.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md
  - **Rationale:** A shared social-register cluster: art-world and literary name-dropping, sensual description (hair/eyes/legs), and “soigné” interior scenes, with repeated jasmine and Wilde/Whistler anchoring.
  - **Key anchors:** post‑Vorticists private view; Ronald Firbank; Wilde/Whistler “You will, Oscar, you will”; “soigné” parquet venue; yellow-jasmine/Barbara description; dessert-order banter + attribution obsession.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N21` (dazed infatuation + bar/tea imagery): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md
    - `N32` (“Type” classifier / Wilde-allusion voice): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_65.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md
    - `N01` (Aquarius pen / “Ecky” bar voice): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
    - `N05` (Haslemere/school + art register): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md
    - `N19` (comic coastal punster): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
    - Singletons: `N29` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md), `N30` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_38.md), `N14` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md), `N37` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md), `N23` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md), `N17` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md), `N26` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md)
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** these are shown to be multiple unrelated narrators using similar “learned allusion + attraction” techniques with no shared participants or setting markers.
  - **Next falsification check:** maintain the sub-strands above and only merge across them when a shared participant or phrase-level anchor repeats (not just “jasmine” or general name-dropping); people-index shows only one multi-page bridge inside this set: `P01` Henry across Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md + Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md, so treat any broader merge as `MAYBE` unless Henry is clearly the same figure and a second anchor emerges.

- **Cluster:** Time obsession + calendar anchors (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_20.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_25.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Rationale:** These pages treat time as a puzzle surface (explicit “to-day” historic hooks, “closing day” framing, or overt time-factor/clock logic), suggesting a constraint layer that will later drive ordering.
  - **Key anchors:** “coming of age hours” (21:00); “to-day” death-date hooks (e.g., Gainsborough); Nelson’s blind-eye/arm-loss “to-day” anchor; “closing day in Potsdam”; “time factor”.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N34` time-factor / Didling anchor: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_20.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_25.md
    - `N08` clock-hour pun: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md
    - `N03` Clement voice time hook (also botany/Whitman overlap): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
    - `N25` papers/interview date hook (also paper/money overlap): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md
    - `N26` breakfast/second-sight + “to-day” (also botany overlap): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md
    - `N22` Defoe death-day hook: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md
    - `N27` Day/Knight pun + time-limit frame: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
    - `N17` dog-watch / “first dog” timekeeping: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
    - `N05` Columbus/Palos date cue: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md
    - `N16` smell-memory + calendar hint: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md
    - `N12` poison logistics + time constraint (also botany overlap): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
    - `N15` assassination-date hook / “first” frame: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md
    - `N37` deceased-introduction date hook (also aesthetic overlap): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md
    - `N02` dog voice timekeeping (also dog overlap): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “to-day” and related time phrases are purely decorative and cannot be grounded to specific dates/events, or dates conflict irreconcilably when cross-checked.
  - **Next falsification check:** extract a single explicit calendar date candidate per page (where possible) and test for duplication/consistency (without imposing sequence); people-index suggests no stable multi-page bridges inside this set beyond `P01` Henry, supporting the interpretation that this is primarily a constraint/motif layer rather than a single narrative strand.

- **Cluster:** Whitman quotation collage (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_51.md
  - **Rationale:** Dense Whitman quotation runs (plus self-conscious commentary on scansion/fit) suggest either one Whitman-saturated narrator voice or a deliberate “Whitman layer” reused across a small subset of pages.
  - **Key anchors:** “Henceforth I ask not good fortune…”; “What chemistry! That the winds are really not infectious”; “I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers.”
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N03` Clement voice with Whitman layer: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
    - `N31` Surrey place-pun + Whitman/botany register: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md
    - `N36` passing-through travel + heartbeat + Whitman cadence: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_51.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Whitman quotations appear broadly across many narrators without other shared tells; treat as a motif cluster only.
  - **Next falsification check:** treat as a motif layer spanning multiple narrators (`N03`/`N31`/`N36`) unless a repeated, non-Whitman phrasing/participant bridges them; identify whether the connective tissue (pills, travel posture, “instructions”) supports a merge or forces a split.

**Macro overlap map (pages in 2+ macro strands)**

This is descriptive only: overlaps here do not imply ordering or shared narrator without additional anchors.

- Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md → Paper artifacts + money pressure; Time obsession + calendar anchors

**Macro coverage audit (pages currently in 0 macro strands)**

Macro coverage is complete (0 pages currently in 0 macro strands). Treat the newly promoted “edge overlap” assignments as `MAYBE` unless a second independent anchor appears.

**Bridge audit (candidate cross-strand connectors)**

Goal: highlight likely “join surfaces” between macro strands (people/place/object anchors) without proposing order. Treat everything here as `MAYBE` until a stronger continuity hook appears.

- **Overlap-page bridges (highest-signal joins):**
  - Paper/money ↔ Time/calendar (3 overlaps): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md.
    - `N22` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md): Defoe death-day “to-day” (explicit historic date hook layered over a “figures/letters” decoding register).
    - `N17` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md): dog-watch timekeeping (“end of the second dog”) + “yesterday’s Sunday paper” spoonerism anchor.
    - `N25` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md): interview papers + Cardinal de Rohan acquittal “to-day” (explicit historic date hook).
    - **Tightening check:** keep only where the time hook is date-derivable or explicit timekeeping (not generic “to-day” scene texture).
  - Aesthetic/high-society ↔ Time/calendar (3 overlaps): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md.
    - `N17` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md): Selfridges/Bond Street social register + “first dog” (LIKELY dog-watch timekeeping).
    - `N05` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md): art references (Beardsley/Rops) + Columbus leaving Palos (3 Aug) date hook.
    - `N37` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md): rapturous Barbara/beachwear register + Nelson “blind sailor” + arm-loss “to-day” (explicit historic date hook).
    - **Tightening check:** treat timekeeping-only pages as edge-overlap unless a second independent calendar anchor appears.
  - Botany/poison ↔ Detective/violence (2 overlaps): Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md.
    - `N16` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md): Baker Street / “investigation” framing (Typhoon/Taifun scene texture) + horticultural “Jew’s-lime” engrafting-wax odour.
    - `N16` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md): corpse proximity + stealth/eavesdropping + “led up the garden (path)” idiom literalised.
    - **Tightening check:** keep only where the botany element is concrete (named plant/substance or explicit horticultural work) and the violence/crime frame is in-scene (not a detachable quotation layer).
  - Single-page overlaps (treat as low-confidence until a second independent anchor appears): Aesthetic ↔ Botany (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md); Detective/violence ↔ Paper/money (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md); Botany ↔ Time (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md); Botany ↔ Whitman (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md); Time ↔ Whitman (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md); Aesthetic ↔ Paper/money (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md); Dog POV ↔ Time (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md).

- **Cross-page bridges (non-overlap; higher-signal named anchors):**
  - `P16` May (see `Indexes/people.md`): Paper/money pages (14/98; plus any additional May pages) ↔ Botany/poison pages (71/75/80). Falsifier: “May” resolves as month/pun in one strand, or May’s role/relationships are incompatible across strands.
  - `P50` Sir Paul Trinder (see `Indexes/people.md`): Paper/money interview pages (52/53) ↔ Botany/poison host/poison pages (59/80). Falsifier: Sir Paul’s identifying details (title/context/behaviour) clearly differ between strands.
  - Southend-on-Sea / Kursaal geography (see `Indexes/places.md`): Aesthetic page (38: Southend memory) ↔ Detective/violence page (100: Kursaal at Southend). Falsifier: one reference points to a different “Southend” or the Kursaal is not Southend’s Kursaal in context.
  - Aconite mention (see `Indexes/objects_motifs.md`): Botany/poison page (80) ↔ Detective/violence page (91). Falsifier: aconite is incidental on one side and does not participate in the same “means/method” register.

- **Narrator bridges (multi-macro join surfaces):**
  - `N01` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md) spans Paper/money (pen/handwriting) ↔ Aesthetic/high-society (venue/menu-title register). Treat “to-day” phrasing on these pages as generic until a date-derivable anchor appears.
  - `N16` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md) spans Botany/poison, Paper/money, Detective/violence, and Time/calendar via smell-memory + evidence/violence framing; treat as a high-signal bridge unless the voice splits.
  - `N17` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md) spans Paper/money and Aesthetic/high-society through the shared Time/calendar register (dog-watch “first dog” timekeeping + London geography).
  - `N26` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md) spans Botany/poison + Time/calendar (Waterloo-day “to-day”) and Aesthetic/high-society (breakfast/second-sight voice); treat the time layer as anchored on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md unless reinforced elsewhere.

### Phase 3 narrator clusters (detail)

Clusters prefixed with `Nxx` map to `Indexes/narrators.md`. Overlap is allowed; **do not add within-cluster sequencing in Phase 3**.

- **Cluster:** `N01` Aquarius pen / “Ecky” bar voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Rationale:** Pen/hand/income fixation + astrology wordplay + “Dawn/Moon” venue language suggest a consistent narrator signature.
  - **Key anchors:** “mottled black and silver Aquarius”; “ruin my hand”; desserts/cocktails treated as titled items; “the Dawn”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Alexander (“Ecky”) is later shown to be a different POV than the Aquarius-pen narrator, or “bad for the hand” is a widely shared motif across voices.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N01):**
    - **Sequence A — Moon/Dawn table scene** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
      - **Why:**
        - Both pages stage the narrator between “the Moon” and “the Dawn” and use near-identical hand/temperance logic (“bad for the hand” ↔ “ruin my hand”) alongside a woman seated opposite the narrator.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md’s arrival beat (“Ah, here she is… into the chair opposite”) reads as a clean prelude to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md’s continuation (“She accepts Lover’s Delight from me… urges… Banana Split… Ecky passes over to the Dawn”).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - “the Moon”/“the Dawn” is later shown to be time-of-day metaphor rather than a spatial venue pair, or the woman/cast on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md is shown to be incompatible with the woman/cast on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md.
    - **Sequence B — Aquarius pen seaside scene (unplaced)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
      - **Why:**
        - Shares the distinctive Aquarius/handwriting register (Aquarius pen ↔ Aquarius/Gemini pun), but lacks a phrase-level setting/cast anchor to place it relative to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Casy Ferris / St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine is shown to be a different narrator/setting altogether, forcing Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md out of `N01`.
  - **Next falsification check:** search for a second anchor (Casy Ferris, St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine, “whaups,” or the “dead old man”) on any other `N01`-adjacent page before attempting to place Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md within the Moon/Dawn sequence.

- **Cluster:** `N12` Calabar/digitalis poison-logistics + murder-as-genre voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
  - **Rationale:** Shared poison anchors (Calabar/digitalis) and a consistent practical, darkly comic “murder mechanics” register (counts, pursuit set-pieces, try-again planning) suggest a stable narrator signature.
  - **Key anchors:** Calabar bean/physostigma; digitalis; murder-counting language; “Murders were funny things”; “give him another day”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Calabar/digitalis references recur widely across unrelated voices, or the pursuit/murder-count tone is shown to be a separate narrator from the poison-logistics pages.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N12):**
    - **Sequence A — Calabar introduced → next-morning doubt** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md explicitly “brought in… Calabar Bean” after the victim scene, while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md opens “on the morning after I had introduced him to the person most concerned…,” making p36 read like the follow-on reflection.
        - Both pages bind Calabar/digitalis to Henry-in-scene + corpse-handling language (blood/body; burial with eyes showing).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - “introduced him to the person most concerned” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md is later shown to refer to a different “him”/recipient than the Calabar/digitalis action in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md.
    - **Sequence B — Henry spree escalation (counted murders → knock → manhunt)** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md references Henry’s “first two killings,” Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md counts a third and fourth victim and ends with an “official knock,” and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md continues into an active police pursuit with the flying squad and an escape attempt.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Any of the “killings/victim” language is proven figurative, or the Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md pursuit is later revealed as an embedded/imagined story unrelated to the corpse scenes.
    - **Sequence C — Trinder outcome (failed → succeeded)** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md states the “bane… failed” and notes it is awkward with Trinder about; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md opens with the narrator realising they “succeeded” and declares a “figurehead beard” (plausibly Trinder) will “plough… seas no more.”
        - Both pages keep the same arch, punning murder‑logistics register (meals/time markers, investigation language, death-by-plan framing).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - “Trinder” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md is unrelated to the “figurehead beard” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md, or the “failed/succeeded” contrast is shown to refer to different acts.
    - **Sequence D — gelsemium let-down → digitalis proof (tentative)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md frames a prior poison (“Electric Febrifuge” active ingredient) as having “let me down” before shifting someone onto foxgloves (digitalis), while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md explicitly says “on the very day” the narrator “proved digitalis purpurea.”
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Foxgloves/digitalis in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md are shown to be ornamental (not an operational poison thread), or “proved digitalis” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md refers to an unrelated experiment.
    - **Sequence E — spareroom/garden continuity (tentative)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md
      - **Why:**
        - Both pages reference the spare-room in the same house (“old spare-room in this very house” / “unsatisfactory visit to the spareroom”) and share the same poison-by-gardening register (failed remedy → foxgloves; ordeal-bean disappointment → plant-combination testing).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md’s “old mineralogist” scene is later anchored to a different narrator/setting, making the shared spare-room reference incidental.
  - **Next falsification check:** stress-test whether “Henry” is a single consistent in-world person across the `N12` sub-strands (killer/manhunt vs “peerless investigator”); if incompatible, split the cluster into two narrators and keep only the Calabar/digitalis pages in `N12`.

- **Cluster:** `N13` Host/guest poisoning + coastal-house segment (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md)
  - **Rationale:** Pages 86–87 share a continuous host/guest/patient poisoning frame with Yeats/Whitman quotations and a distinctive coastal-house setting; this reads as a coherent narrator segment.
  - **Key anchors:** Caroline Jasmine; Mithradates inoculation; Yeats “bent low and low…” continuation; bay landscape → corpse imagery.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the apparent continuation is later shown to be coincidental (e.g., cut-and-paste echo) with incompatible settings/participants.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N13):**
    - **Sequence A — Yeats quotation continuation** (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md ends mid-quotation (“But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet”), and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md begins with the completion (with CJ’s substitution), making `86 → 87` a hard adjacency.
        - The same coastal-house/guest/patient frame continues without a scene break (Caroline Jasmine care → bay landscape + “my guest…” + death-letter imagery).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - If the Yeats lines are later found to be repeated elsewhere in the puzzle in a way that makes this “continuation” non-unique, or if the “guest/patient” is shown to switch incompatibly between pages.
  - **Resolved check:** attempted to link Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md into the Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md run by searching for a phrase-level anchor (e.g., “bottled worms,” “inviolate spring,” “Fleming’s tincture,” “sherry”) and found **no repeats** on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md/Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md; additionally, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md’s guest is explicitly “she,” while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md’s guest is “Sir Paul.” Treat Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md as **overlap-only** until a stronger shared anchor appears.
  - **Overlap candidate:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md shares “Caroline” and the Yeats source line that Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md substitutes, but lacks the coastal-house/Sanders/letter anchors; keep overlap-only unless a second independent `N13` anchor emerges.
  - **Next falsification check:** if Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md is kept in `N13`, require a second independent anchor to the coastal-house segment (e.g., Caroline Jasmine, Sanders/bay house, or a distinctive repeated phrasing) before using it for ordering.

- **Cluster:** `N15` “Green” victim + Compact syringe (first killing) voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md
  - **Rationale:** A consistent self-justifying voice frames a named target (Green) and an explicitly admitted “first” killing, with a specific method/tool cue (Compact hypodermic) and a shared date-anchor habit (Perceval).
  - **Key anchors:** victim named Green; “it was my first”; “Compact” syringe; Spencer Perceval assassination reference.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “my first” is non-lethal, or Green/Perceval anchors resolve as unrelated allusions in different voices.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N15):**
    - **Sequence A — resolve-to-act → first killing** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md ends with the narrator weighing that they may have to “do the thing” themselves and “think it over,” while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md immediately presents the narrator having used a specific “tool” (“Compact”) and calling it “my first,” which reads like the follow-through beat.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md’s “young women are green… Green was the name of the victim” is compatible with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md’s tactile, personal aftermath tone (“last little contact with the bony ankles… so warm and so soon… so cold”).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md’s victim is later identified as someone other than the “Green” target in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md (different gender/identity/context), or Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md’s “do the thing” is later shown to refer to a non-lethal act.
    - **Sequence B — first-killing memory → later planning** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md’s reflective tone (“alone again… visualise… detached calm”) could be a retrospective preface to a later decision about a new named victim (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - If Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md’s “Green… victim” is shown to be the same person killed with the “Compact” tool, the more natural progression is Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md.
  - **Next falsification check:** look for a later page that names “Green” in a clearly post‑mortem register or repeats the “Compact” tool cue; without a third anchor, keep both internal orders alive but treat Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md as the default.

- **Cluster:** `N16` St. Bruno / smell-memory + incinerator-evidence voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md
  - **Rationale:** A consistent narrator signature uses smell/odour as an organising device (including synaesthetic metaphors), with self-aware narration and abrupt associative pivots; Pages 44–45 add Henry-focused “problem/evidence” detail to the same sensory-first register.
  - **Key anchors:** “Smells meant a lot to me”; “Jew’s lime… concomitant odour”; “first St. Bruno”; Vera Cruz fonda memory; half-burned marriage certificate in an incinerator; medlar+vine “two notes of a chord” (venetian red/peridot).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 7 or Page 55 is later shown to be a different narrator/scene using smell imagery incidentally, or the Henry/Hodge anchors in Pages 44–45 are proven to belong to a separate voice from the smell-synaesthesia register.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N16):**
    - **Sequence A — Henry/incinerator flats episode** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md’s self-critique about failing to “tell… a story vividly” naturally leads into Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md’s disjointed “What had I actually seen?” evidence-dump.
        - Both pages share Henry-in-scene plus surveillance/evidence-destruction cues (incinerator + half-burned certificate ↔ “great building of many flats” + “stealing at the doors”).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md’s incinerator/certificate is later shown to belong to a different episode/location than Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md’s flats scene, or Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md’s Henry/corpse scene is anchored to a different narrator.
    - **Sequence B — Typhoon quotation hinge (tentative)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md) → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md opens with rereading *Typhoon* and the “investigating judge” passage, while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md begins with the “half Pole, half Frenchman…” line and continues with Typhoon-specific names (Hélène, absinthe), making p7 a plausible prelude to p45’s Typhoon digression.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - *Typhoon* quotations are shown to recur broadly across unrelated narrators, or Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md’s “Baker Steet” immobility is literal and incompatible with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md’s flats surveillance.
  - **Next falsification check:** place Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md (Aug 5 holiday anchor) only if a second independent link appears (repeat of the Bramley/medlar/vine chord register, or an explicit calendar anchor on another `N16` page).

- **Cluster:** `N17` Dog-watch/capstan + Kipling-quoting punster voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
  - **Rationale:** A shared nautical timekeeping register (dog-watch/capstan) and heavy Kipling embedding, alongside punny London geography, suggests a consistent narrator signature.
  - **Key anchors:** dog-watch time marker; capstan bar; Kipling’s “The Mary Gloster”; Selfridges/Bond Street wordplay; Swift/De Quincey name-drops.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the shared nautical/Kipling anchors are shown to be generic motifs reused across unrelated narrators.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N17):**
    - **Sequence A — first dog → end of second dog (same West‑End patch)** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md says “it was still the first dog,” while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md places the scene “at the end of the second dog,” giving a natural within‑evening time progression.
        - Location continuity is plausible: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md’s Selfridges/Bond Street register aligns with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md waiting “in Orchard” (MAYBE Orchard Street near Selfridges), suggesting the same London patch.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - “first dog”/“second dog” is later shown to be literal-dog framing (not nautical timekeeping), or “Orchard” is proven to be a different place/scene than the Selfridges/Bond Street setting.
    - **Sequence B — timekeeping words are non-temporal (fallback)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
      - **Why:**
        - If “first dog” and “second dog” are revealed as non-temporal (e.g., a training/metaphor register), ordering must rest on other anchors; keep the reverse as a live alternative until timekeeping is secured.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Any later `N17` page (if found) or a clarified nautical-time cue fixes “first dog” as a time-of-day marker, restoring Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md as default.
  - **Next falsification check:** confirm whether “Orchard” can be pinned to the same London setting as the Selfridges/Bond Street references (phrase-level or explicit place marker); if not, keep the time-only ordering as `MAYBE`.

- **Cluster:** `N18` Diary/verify + falser-hand forgery voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 78’s narrator voice is tightly anchored by explicit falsifiability framing and document/handwriting manipulation language.
  - **Key anchors:** “verify… I never travel without my diary”; “mimic artistry”; “falser hand”; “new instrument”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “diary/verify” language appears elsewhere in an unmistakably different voice, or Page 78 is later shown to be quoting another speaker rather than the narrator.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N18):**
    - Singleton page; no internal ordering possible yet.
  - **Resolved check:** searched will/forgery pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md) for phrase-level anchors (“verify/diary,” “falser hand,” “mimic artistry,” “new instrument,” “lips were wiped clean”) and found **no repeats**; keep Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md as a standalone voice that is thematically adjacent to the will/forgery strand but not yet placeable within it.
  - **Next falsification check:** look for a second non-quotation anchor that recurs with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md (e.g., “new instrument,” “lips were wiped clean,” “Prussian beast”) before using it to stitch the will/forgery cluster (Phase 5).

- **Cluster:** `N19` Comic coastal punster (buttonholes/lighthouse/brand riffs) (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages use a rapid-fire punning, brand-name riffing voice and share coastal danger markers (sea/lighthouse) while positioning Henry as a colourful centre of attention.
  - **Key anchors:** buttonhole scene behind the church; boy about to tumble into the sea; ruined lighthouse; “Emperor’s Peg” + vitriol/applejack; Bisto/Cerebos riffing; O.M./M.O./OM wordplay.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 5’s narrator voice proves incompatible with Page 4’s (different social position/setting with no shared tells beyond generic puns).
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N19):**
    - **Sequence A — church-side comedy → lighthouse-side distraction** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md establishes the coastal setting with church/puddles + “boy… to tumble into the sea,” while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md shifts to the ruined lighthouse as the next major location-beat in the same seaside strip.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md’s suspicion of a “beautiful” woman (“Can I suspect her?”) aligns with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md’s irritation at distractions while “poor Henry” pursues an “intended fifth,” reading like an escalation from social comedy to stakes.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - The church/buttonhole and ruined lighthouse are later anchored to incompatible places/timelines, or the “boy” incident is shown to be a different scene from the “new young man” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md.
    - **Sequence B — scene order uncertain (keep reverse alive)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md
      - **Why:**
        - Without a hard sentence/quote continuation, the two vignettes could be non-adjacent beats in the same coastal day; keep the reverse available until a stronger anchor appears.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Any phrase-level continuation is found (shared “new young man”/boy rescue, repeated objects, or an explicit “after/before” marker) that fixes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md as the earlier scene.
  - **Next falsification check:** search for a third page that repeats one of the unique N19 anchors (Sir Roland Mowthalorn / gin-faced Annie / “Emperor’s Peg” / ruined lighthouse / Lesurques↔Cirque pun) to decide whether Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md are adjacent or merely co-clustered.

- **Cluster:** `N20` Bloomsbury/nomenclature + grim-scene voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages foreground classed self-consciousness and wordplay about naming, framed against grim bodily/violent contexts and “reckon with Henry” pressure.
  - **Key anchors:** “Bloomsbury”; “Newdigate fringe”; “nomenclature business”; “Caseus, ah!”; hand dropping to hip pocket.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the naming/wordplay is shown to be incidental, or the scenes are later explicitly narrated by different named speakers.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N20):**
    - **Sequence A — “reckon with Henry” → two bodies in the market place** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md culminates in action-readiness (“My hand dropped to my hip pocket… I had to reckon with Henry”), and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md presents the immediate grim tableau with Henry “stooping over the other body,” consistent with an aftermath beat.
        - Both pages imply a paired-loss/bodies frame: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md (“even two like these two”) ↔ Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md (“the other body”), which naturally reads as the same two-person incident.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md’s “these two” is later shown to refer to something other than two people/bodies (e.g., two sounds/voices only), or Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md’s “other body” is shown to be unrelated (different place/timeline than Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md).
    - **Sequence B — scene order uncertain (keep reverse alive)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
      - **Why:**
        - If Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md’s “these two” refers to sounds/voices rather than bodies, it could be a later reflective preface rather than a lead-in to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md’s corpse scene.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - A clearer continuity marker appears tying Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md’s “this very place” to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md’s named location (Grantham market place), or a direct phrase-level echo fixes the sequence.
  - **Resolved check:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md’s “conduit dating from 1597… in the market place” is a high-signal Grantham anchor; treat Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md’s “in this very place” as referring to the same Grantham setting within the `N20` incident, supporting Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md.
  - **Next falsification check:** find a third page that repeats a unique N20 anchor (Grantham/conduit, “Newdigate fringe,” “hip pocket,” “Caseus, ah!”) to decide whether `N20` is a tight two-page incident or a broader run.

- **Cluster:** `N21` Dazed infatuation + bar/tea imagery voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md
  - **Rationale:** A recurring narrator signature combines self-described dazedness with sensual fixation on surfaces/hair and a social drink/tea register, with Henry repeatedly serving as the axis of fascination or correction.
  - **Key anchors:** “electrically aware” bar presence; cocktail after cocktail + cigarette; Babs copper hair + first rain; “I always feel a bit dazed”; Henry policing diction (“got me”); Browning “Saul” excerpt + “what Henry would think of next” anticipation.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** these are shown to be separate narrators sharing only general “sensual description” tropes.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N21):**
    - **Sequence A — Browning “Saul” line continuation lock** (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md quotes Browning “Saul” up to “those lilies still living and blue,” and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md begins with the immediate next line (“Just broken to twine round thy harp-strings…”), creating a stanza-continuation lock.
        - The prose also fits as a beat progression: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md anticipates a “cardiac revelation,” and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md opens “What could come next?” before the “electrically aware” encounter.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - If another page is found that quotes the missing intervening line(s) (making this continuation non-unique), or if Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md’s Browning header is shown to be a non-adjacent epigraph convention reused across unrelated scenes.
    - **Sequence B — first introduction to Henry → later guided scene** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md frames the narrator’s “first introduction” to Henry and early fascination; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md treat Henry as an established reference-point/guide.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - “first introduction” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md is later shown to refer to a different Henry than the guide/axis figure in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md/Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md.
    - **Sequence C — post‑encounter fixation at tea (tentative)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md → (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md)
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md intensifies the “she has got me” register and keeps Henry’s policing/correction role, reading plausibly as a later beat after the first “electrically aware” encounter.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - “she” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md is proven to be someone other than the woman in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, or the tea vocabulary is shown to be coded and unrelated to the seduction scene.
  - **Next falsification check:** resolve whether “she” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md is the same woman as Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md’s tall “Julienne?” (need a phrase-level or attribute-level repeat beyond generic infatuation language).

- **Cluster:** `N22` Morbid London decoder (plague quotation voice) (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 2 combines a distinctive “figures and letters” decoding finish line with a sepulchral London observation filtered through an embedded plague quotation.
  - **Key anchors:** “figures and letters swam”; “There were no more”; plague prose snippets + “writer had strangely died to-day.”
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the plague quotation and decoding framing recur as generic motifs across unrelated narrators.

- **Cluster:** `N23` Music-hall cosmetics / Highgate Empire voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md
  - **Rationale:** A distinctive theatre/cosmetics vignette voice (false eyebrows, make-up artist, Highgate Empire) stands apart from other Henry-linked scenes.
  - **Key anchors:** Highgate Empire; Russian ballet; false eyebrows in clear soup; “man who made up”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show this is a quoted anecdote recounted by multiple narrators with different voices.

- **Cluster:** `N24` Scotland Yard collapse / Kursaal voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 100’s narrator is physically incapacitated and frames a collapse scene via Scotland Yard and specific Southend Kursaal geography, with a gloating antagonist and a valedictory “Good-bye, Henry.”
  - **Key anchors:** Scotland Yard; Woolworth’s; Kursaal; buttonhole motif; “how ill… about my heart”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the collapse frame is purely rhetorical or the Scotland Yard/Kursaal layer is reused by other narrators.

- **Cluster:** `N25` Quicksands-of-crime interviewer / papers voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 34’s “ironic comment” and “innocent child” moralising register matches Page 52’s crime/innocence rhetoric; Pages 52–53 then supply the same voice in a concrete “interview/papers” scene culminating in a contemptuous introduction of Sir Paul Trinder. Page 33 adds a compatible clandestine, debt-framed “papers/letter being read” vignette.
  - **Key anchors:** “I always pay my debts”; “behind the armchair”; “ironic comment”; “innocent child”; “end of my interview”; “make yourself comfortable with the papers”; “commentary… page after page”; “introduced to me”; “well-fed swine”; Westphalian ham.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Westphalian ham/papers language is shown to be a widely reused table-setting motif, or the “introduced to me” Trinder description is later anchored to a different narrator/setting.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N25):**
    - **Sequence A — interview/papers run** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md establishes an interview mechanic (“make yourself comfortable with the papers”; “end of my interview”) and forecasts “commentary… page after page”; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md reads naturally as a later/next “subject introduced” beat in the same enquiry (contempt register + “introduced to me”).
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md repeats Westphalian ham and “bits of paper” reading, which fits the p52 table/papers setup and supplies an additional “paper-by-paper” beat before the Trinder introduction.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md is later anchored to a different narrator/setting with no shared interview mechanics beyond ham/papers; if so, drop it and revert to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md’s Sir Paul Trinder introduction is shown to be a separate narrator/setting (e.g., incompatible participants or contradictory scene mechanics).
    - **Sequence B — debts/bills clandestine vignette** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md
      - **Why:**
        - Both pages foreground debt/bills language (“I always pay my debts” / “Bills should always be met squarely”) and a covert/manipulative register (p33 narrator hidden behind the armchair; p34 “play one tool against another”).
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md’s opener (“petty employ…”) can be read as a meta nod to the concealment/eavesdropping vignette in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - The bills/debts phrasing is shown to be generic across unrelated voices and no phrase-level anchor links the two scenes.
  - **Next falsification check:** confirm whether the “innocent child” echo between Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md functions as narrator self-echo (same voice) rather than a detachable quotation, and seek a second independent continuity marker (shared participant/setting prop) before asserting adjacency between the debt vignette and the interview run.

- **Cluster:** `N26` “Awful and literal sense” breakfast-recapping / second-sight voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages share the distinctive parenthetical aside “in the awful and literal sense of the word” and a morning/breakfast framing that mixes self-mocking wordplay with heightened mental-state reporting (recapitulation/second-sight).
  - **Key anchors:** repeated “awful and literal sense” phrasing; breakfast setting (toast/marmalade; sausage); insomnia + “agony of recapitulation”; “Clare” (clairvoyant/clairaudient pun).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the shared aside is shown to be a common quotation reused across multiple voices, or the surrounding diction/register proves incompatible beyond the single repeated phrase.

- **Cluster:** `N27` Peebles mineralogy lecturer / bell-summoning voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 9’s narrator is sharply characterised by a snobbish servant-bell frame and a specific academic self-positioning (mineralogy lectures at “Peebles University” with assistant Charles Day), plus an explicit Day/Knight pun.
  - **Key anchors:** “sound of the bell”; “lower orders”; “lectures on mineralogy at Peebles University”; “assistant Charles Day”; “Day… Knight cometh”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the Peebles/mineralogy identity is later shown to belong to a different narrator, or the scene is revealed as a quoted anecdote.

- **Cluster:** `N28` Window-throw / “no detective” voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md
  - **Rationale:** A distinctive black-humoured violence vignette culminates in a pointed narrator disavowal of detective identity, with stitched-in Browning/Shakespeare and a “Speckled Band” mishearing riff.
  - **Key anchors:** “The victim… blocked… the window”; “Go find the bottom!”; “pulled up his socks… heaved outward”; “Band, Speckled”; “thank goodness, I was no detective”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the scene is later shown to be metaphorical or an embedded quotation recounted by another narrator, or the same “no detective” self-exculpation recurs under an incompatible voice elsewhere.

- **Cluster:** `N29` Post‑Vorticists / Firbank / “chamber within chamber” anxiety voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 37’s voice blends art-world framing and ornate decor with anxious weapon/evidence language and a credibility fear (“who would believe me?”), anchored by the Firbank/Malta name-drop.
  - **Key anchors:** “yellow jasmine”; “rococo mirror”; “private view… post‑Vorticists”; Ronald Firbank in Malta; “chamber within chamber”; “open the bores”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the art/Firbank layer is shown to be detachable quotation collage used by multiple narrators, or the “bores/chambers” language is proven non-weapon and the voice aligns with an existing narrator signature.

- **Cluster:** `N30` Southend “tragic fortnight” / Sonia Gordon + omelette-stab voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_38.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 38 combines classical self-awareness, covert observation, and a Southend memory with abrupt violence language and deliberate misnaming in the Marat vignette.
  - **Key anchors:** “Video meliora proboque”; Sonia Gordon; “tragic fortnight at Southend”; omelette/eggs metaphor; “as I stabbed once”; Brontë-for-Corday misnaming.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “stabbed” is later shown to be purely culinary, or the Sonia Gordon/Southend anchors recur under a clearly different narrator voice.

- **Cluster:** `N31` Flecker/Whitman compost + Surrey place-pun + pill voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md
  - **Rationale:** A dense allusive voice splices Flecker and Whitman quotations into narrative reflection, with pill-taking and Surrey place-name wordplay as recurring techniques.
  - **Key anchors:** Flecker-ghazel substitution (“some to Flecker turn to pray…”); “What chemistry! That the winds are really not infectious”; “I took a pill”; Thames Ditton/Long Ditton pun.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Whitman/Flecker quotation-stitching is shown to be a generic technique used across many narrators with no shared voice tells, or the pill/place-pun register aligns more cleanly with an existing narrator signature.

- **Cluster:** `N32` “Type” classifier / gilded metaphors + Wilde-allusion voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_65.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md
  - **Rationale:** A consistent narrator voice frames people as “types” and treats interpretation as competitive “harvest/gleaning”, with recurring gold/silver/green-leaf metaphors and embedded Wilde context (Earnest epigram; Whistler-to-Oscar jibe). Page 62 is a `MAYBE` extension on the gold/silver separation framing.
  - **Key anchors:** “I thought I knew the type”; “learned in a macabre way, even distinguished”; “pigeon-holing by type”; gold/silver visual metaphors (“gold… silver…”; “dissociate… gold… from the silver”); “You will, Oscar, you will.”
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the repeated “type” judgement is shown to be a reused quotation, the dining/hunting vignette (Pages 89–90) is later anchored to a clearly different narrator from Page 65’s reading/typing competition, or Page 62’s gold/silver dissociation proves to be an unrelated one-off metaphor.

- **Cluster:** `N33` Medehamstede / Pasquier claret + short-story meta voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_72.md
  - **Rationale:** A distinctive, meta-fictional narrator voice frames a travel pause with claret-as-remedy and a Paris/Rue de la Harpe anecdote, then riffs on story structure (“embrace first, plot after”) via a “complete novel” magazine.
  - **Key anchors:** “old Medehamstede”; Pasquier’s claret; Rue de la Harpe; “last paragraphs of the short stories”; “The complete novel length… Savage Conqueror.”
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the magazine/short-story register is later shown to be a quoted inset rather than narrator voice, or the anchor set recurs under an unmistakably different narrator elsewhere.

- **Cluster:** `N34` Time-factor / Didling wordplay + antiquarian brass voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_20.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_25.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages share obsessive time/mortality rumination and self-deprecating punning (“Didlittle” chain), with an antiquarian bent (brass inscription) and a morning-routine framing.
  - **Key anchors:** “time factor”; Dolittle → Didlittle → Didling/didlet; “by the Mole” + “oldest brass in England”; “my waking, my strong tea, and my first pill”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the wordplay/time register is shown to be a generic technique across multiple narrators, or the pages are later anchored to incompatible settings/participants.

- **Cluster:** `N35` Rupee chapter / money suspicion + wickedness anxiety voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_18.md
  - **Rationale:** A single-page narrator voice is anchored by editorial/manuscript talk, money-motive introspection, and a distinctive metaphor chain that turns biblical “fishes/birds” into a menu-course suspicion.
  - **Key anchors:** “chapter on the fall of the rupee… omit”; “metallic problems”; “no single dish would satisfy the man… soup… fishes… birds”; “really wicked person”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the editorial “rupee chapter” anchor is later shown to be a detachable quotation/reused reference, or the surrounding voice aligns more cleanly with an existing narrator signature.

- **Cluster:** `N36` Passing-through travel + heartbeats + Whitman cadence voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_51.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 51 is strongly characterised by a “passing through” travel posture, bodily self-monitoring (counting between heartbeats), and dense Whitman quotation cadence.
  - **Key anchors:** “passing through”; “All England for a thousand guineas… twenty-nine times in ten years”; “counted a distinct ninety between each beat of my heart”; “I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers.”
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the Whitman-heavy phrasing is later shown to be a generic quotation collage used by multiple narrators, or the sporting/heartbeat anchors recur clearly under a different voice.

- **Cluster:** `N37` Deceased-introduction + Barbara yellow-jasmine bathing voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md
  - **Rationale:** A single-page narrator voice mixes anxious curiosity about a “deceased” who arranged an introduction with rapturous beach/poolside description and a crisp Nelson “to-day” date anchor.
  - **Key anchors:** “the deceased wished us to know each other”; Barbara “yellow jasmine” one-piece; Dagenham bus; converted oast-house; “what the blind sailor said”; “Off went his arm to-day.”
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “deceased” is later shown to be a dead author rather than an in-world person, or the Barbara/Alistair/Dagenham anchors recur under a clearly different narrator voice.

- **Cluster:** `N38` Medical-advice payoff + “May be” pun / Quarry hills voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_98.md
  - **Rationale:** A single-page narrator voice is anchored by a slow payoff-for-identification scene, heavy medical framing, and an explicit “May be” decision pun set against a distinctive sunset landscape.
  - **Key anchors:** “The money changed hands slowly… describe him”; “proper medical advice”; “He went. He went.”; “played the sedulous ape”; “May be. May be not.”; “Quarry hills”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the scene is later shown to be recounted/quoted by another narrator, or the “May be” pun and medical-payoff framing recur under an incompatible voice elsewhere.

- **Cluster:** `N39` Wilde/Earnest echoes + will/forgery voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages embed Wilde/Earnest material alongside will/forgery and pen/stationery attention, suggesting a shared narrator register rather than a generic allusion layer.
  - **Key anchors:** Wilde/Earnest echoes; will/forgery talk; caseful of “strange pens”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Wilde/Earnest lines are shown to be a detachable quotation layer used across unrelated narrators, or the will/forgery contexts resolve to incompatible speakers/settings.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N39):**
    - **Sequence A — church-window prelude → will-at-table forging scene** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md reads as a waiting/prep beat (“Not a woman had entered as yet… ticklish business… Forging ahead… since the woman was not yet dead”), while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md shows the operational scene (“The will was there… caseful of strange pens… wonderful hands at work”).
        - The embedded *Importance of Being Earnest* quotations progress plausibly within Act I (Lane’s “married once… misunderstanding” material on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md vs the later “handbag” material on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md), consistent with a narrator reading/echoing the same text across the two pages.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - The “woman” on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md and the “girl” on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md are clearly different people/plots (making the forgery framing coincidental), or the table/participants are incompatible with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md’s setting.
        - The Earnest quotations are shown to be used non-sequentially (or widely reused), removing the “Act I progression” support.
    - **Sequence B — alternative ordering (unresolved)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md
      - **Why:**
        - If Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md’s “Not a woman had entered as yet” is a later return to the same plan (new location, still awaiting the target), Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md could be an earlier attempt at the will/pen work.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Any concrete time marker anchors one scene as “next day/after” the other.
  - **Resolved check:** corpus search found no non-quotation phrase-level overlap between Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md beyond the general will/forgery + Earnest motifs; additionally, *Importance of Being Earnest* quotation fragments recur elsewhere (e.g., Pages/cains_jawbone_page_65.md), so do not treat “Act I progression” as a decisive adjacency proof. Keep internal ordering at `MAYBE` until a second independent anchor appears.
  - **Next falsification check:** look for a second, non-quotation anchor shared by the two pages (e.g., the green binding device “single star above… sea,” “ticklish business,” “wonderful hands,” or a repeat of Pluckley/Kent); separately, note that Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md’s Greek Anthology “Homonoea” line overlaps Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md (Phase 5 join-candidate, not a Phase 4 ordering claim).

- **Cluster:** `N40` Bills-in-paper / Bryant & May / Left Luggage voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md
  - **Rationale:** A single-page voice anchored by bills-in-the-paper framing plus match/brand and Left Luggage cues; keep as a placeholder until a second page repeats this combination.
  - **Key anchors:** bills + “paper” framing; Bryant & May; Left Luggage Office.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the bills/matches/Left Luggage cues recur under an existing narrator signature with stronger continuity markers (scene mechanics, named participants), making this a motif-only page.

- **Cluster:** `N04` Great Lexicographer / fealty voice (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages use the distinctive “Great Lexicographer” anchor and similar learned, punning diction; fealty/reading-aloud framing suggests a consistent narrator segment.
  - **Key anchors:** “Great Lexicographer”; Ockham’s razor joke; McLeod of that ilk; Bellerophon letters / bait/hook metaphor.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show different narrators/settings using “Great Lexicographer” independently, or the McLeod/Johnson linkage is disproved.

- **Cluster:** Menu-title sweets (Lover’s Delight/Banana Split/Rainbow) (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated named desserts and explicit sundae rules (including Lent) suggest either shared venue/menu continuity or a deliberately reused motif across voices (e.g., `N01`/`N12`/`N14`).
  - **Key anchors:** “Lover’s Delight”; Banana Split; “Rainbow”; Lent “second Sundae” constraint.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N01` bar/dessert titles: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
    - `N12` poison-logistics voice with sweets motif: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
    - `N14` Rainbow Sundae / hair voice: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later context shows the terms are generic one-off jokes with no recurrence or shared setting.

- **Cluster:** `N14` Babbie / Rainbow Sundae / hair-and-allusion voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md
  - **Rationale:** A distinctive infatuated, performatively learned voice combines French verse with dessert-order rules and an obsession with attributing writers, while observing Henry being “tried out” (cap on/off).
  - **Key anchors:** Babbie’s hair fixation; Baudelaire “La Chevelure”; “Rainbow” + Lent “second Sundae” rule; “I have always hated that these writers should be anonymous.”
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show the same motifs used casually by multiple unrelated narrators, or Page 63’s Henry is proven to be a different referent (not the recurring character-name).

- **Cluster:** `N05` School colours / “the Head” voice (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md
  - **Rationale:** Direct sentence continuation plus a consistent school-nostalgia register (the Head, school colours, fives courts, art-name dropping) supports a tight single-voice segment.
  - **Key anchors:** fives courts; old Hall hung with Beardsley/Rops; “the Head”; celebration vs mourning register.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** only if the 66→67 sentence continuation is later shown to be a transcription artifact (unlikely given page integrity checks).
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N05):**
    - **Sequence A — sentence continuation lock** (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md
      - **Why:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md ends “hung round with” and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md begins “the darker works…”, creating an unambiguous syntactic continuation.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:** only if a later integrity check shows a transcription/scan error creating a false continuation (very unlikely).

- **Cluster:** `N09` “Old man” slow-death / letter-blackmail voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Rationale:** A recurring narrator signature links paranoia about an “old man” and a “crucial meeting” (with suspected eavesdropping) to an explicitly witnessed slow death, letter/retaliation anxiety, and a Café Royal time-budget strand tied to an explicit written account.
  - **Key anchors:** “old man”; “done slowly to death”; franked item to “the girl”; threat “do me in”; Café Royal; “told him all, hour by hour, day by day”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “done slowly to death” is figurative, the “he”/retaliation target in Page 70 is clearly not the same “old man” context as Pages 68–69, or the Café Royal + written-account pages (95–96) are shown to be a distinct voice.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N09):**
    - **Sequence A — written account → retaliation fear** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md explicitly narrates the act of writing a full account (“told him all, hour by hour, day by day…”) with pen/ink ritual.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md reads as the immediate aftermath: the narrator has “told all I knew”, leaves a franked item to be found “in the morning” by “the girl”, and fears retaliation (“do me in”).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md’s “franked” item is shown to be unrelated to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md’s written account (different recipient/object), or the timing can’t accommodate a write-then-leave sequence.
    - **Sequence B — café waiting/tea near the writing** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md ↔ Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md’s menu/tea + “waiting… for the possible her” reads as the kind of idle café interval that could bracket Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md’s decision to write.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md’s setting is later shown to be incompatible with the Café Royal context implied by Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md.
    - **Sequence C — old-man thread → written account** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md supplies the “last crucial meeting with the old man” + suspected eavesdropper setup; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md gives the late-night psychological aftermath of witnessing the old man “done slowly to death”.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md’s “hour by hour, day by day” account is compatible with a slow-death timeline; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md then moves into the blackmail/retaliation fear after “told all I knew”.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md’s “done slowly to death” proves figurative, or Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md’s “horrid act” is later shown to be unrelated to the old-man strand.
  - **Next falsification check:** search for a second phrase-level anchor that ties Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md/Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md directly to the Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md/Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md letter thread (beyond generic “old man/he”).

- **Cluster:** `N07` Bunny and Perry (Pro/Con) mental debate (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages personify internal argument as “Bunny and Perry” going at it “hammer and tongs”, with tennis/venue imagery.
  - **Key anchors:** “Bunny and Perry”; “hammer and tongs”; explicit tennis/venue shifts.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later context shows “Bunny and Perry” refers to external people rather than an internal debate trope.

- **Cluster:** `N08` King (“Kipling” name-jibe) narrator (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md)
  - **Rationale:** Pages 85 and 94 share a narrator-name clue (schoolboy “Kipling” jibe → King; narrator sees own name in a window-sign) and a recurring Henry-in-scene frame; additional detective/police allusions suggest nearby overlap with other Henry/detection pages.
  - **Key anchors:** “Kipling” as a name-jibe; narrator seeing their own name printed in a window; Baker Street / detective framing; Bartholomew dog at the table (Page 82) ↔ “Bart” chewing moccasins at a familiar table (Page 15).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the name clue resolves differently, the window-sign name refers to someone/something other than the narrator, or Page 15’s “Bart” is shown not to be the same dog as Bartholomew in Page 82.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N08):**
    - **Sequence A — Henry waiting → driven home** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md ends with “Henry was waiting for me,” while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md contains the follow-through action “I drove Henry home, and left him.”
        - Both pages share the narrator’s self-consciousness and distractibility in Henry-adjacent scenes (window-sign blush + children interruptions in p94; time/automation + post‑business calm in p85).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - If “Henry” in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md is shown to be a different figure from the Henry driven home in Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md (incompatible roles/setting).
    - **Sequence B — dog-at-table continuity (tentative)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md) → (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md)
      - **Why:**
        - Both pages stage the narrator at a “familiar” table with a dog in close contact (Bart chewing moccasins; Bartholomew pawing ankles), consistent with “Bart” as a short form for Bartholomew.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md’s explicit clock-wordplay (“coming of age hours” = 21:00) fits the `N08` signature’s time/wordplay habits.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - “Bart” is later shown not to be the same dog as Bartholomew, or Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md’s voice proves incompatible with the King narrator.
    - **Sequence C — table aftermath (tentative)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md → (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md)
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md ends with concealment at a table (“put Henry’s keenness… below the… salt-cellar”) and “weary business” resolution; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md reads like a stationary comedown at a table (Lapsang + dog) with “cold weight of my certainty” after witnessing “carnal, bloody and unnatural acts.”
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md’s Henry/dog/table context is later anchored as a different narrator/setting from Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md (overlap only, no adjacency).
  - **Next falsification check:** look for a shared prop/phrase that ties Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md (e.g., concealment under a table object, or a repeat of the “certainty/pressure” imagery) before treating the table vignettes as a true run.

- **Cluster:** `N06` Orator/artist + flowers/documents/OGPU voice (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md)
  - **Rationale:** Pages 73, 74, and 75 mix art/oratory identity, French verse, and a secrecy/blackmail register; Pages 75 and 83 continue the flower/rose fixation and eyesight/“documents” concerns.
  - **Key anchors:** May/red-May scent; red/white roses + marigolds/calendula; red rose “sole survivor”; “orange tinted documents”; Goya reproduction confusion; “Will anyone know about them?”; Leningrad/OGPU mention; flower-seller interruption.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “May” resolves purely as the month/plant with no person continuity, or “them/documents” do not recur across pages.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N06):**
    - **Sequence A — Marseille initiation → OGPU purchases → documents** (confidence: `LIKELY`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md ends mid-sentence (“hung round with…”) and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md begins with the completion (“photographs…”), making `73 → 74` a hard adjacency.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md’s “them” (secretly bought items) + failing eyesight (“wretched eyes”) aligns with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md’s “orange tinted documents” and inability to read them (“searchlights of my eyes… not good enough”), and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md’s “two other flowers” naturally picks up Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md’s “red rose and the white only remained.”
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md’s documents/flowers are later anchored to a different setting or narrative purpose from Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md’s “them” (coincidental overlap).
    - **Sequence B — late-night red-rose extension** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md → (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md)
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md returns to the red-rose motif (“red rose, the sole survivor”), plausibly a later state after Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md’s “red rose and the white only remained,” and keeps an “old man” + Henry present in a group scene.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md’s “old man”/Henry context is later shown to be incompatible with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md’s OGPU/Leningrad scene (distinct voices or settings).
    - **Sequence C — May/eye prelude (tentative)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md) → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md supplies “red May” language and a concrete eye-strike by Henry (“hit me… in the eye”), which could explain Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md/Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md’s repeated eyesight failure and the “May” hinge (“blight on the May”).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md’s Henry/May context is later anchored to a different narrator/setting, or “May” resolves as purely seasonal with no cross-page continuity.
  - **Next falsification check:** find a phrase-level anchor that ties Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md to the `73 → 74 → 75` run (beyond generic “old man”/rose), and a second independent anchor that links Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md to the same narrator beyond “May” + eyesight.

- **Cluster:** Coastal imagery (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated sea-adjacent cues (Chine, tumbling into sea, lighthouse) suggest a shared setting or narrator fixation.
  - **Key anchors:** “Chine”; boy tumbling into sea; ruined lighthouse.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N01` chine/sea-bird lyric: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
    - `N19` comic coastal punster + lighthouse: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** setting markers later place these pages in distinct, incompatible locations or show “sea” is figurative.

- **Cluster:** Bells and summoning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
  - **Rationale:** Prominent bell/bell-wire focus; household-service dynamics and anxiety.
  - **Key anchors:** dangling bell-wire (Speckled Band echo); bell “as of a boding gnat”; “time was not unlimited”.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N12` bell-wire anxiety + murder mechanics: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md
    - `N27` bell-summoning lecturer voice: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** bell references resolve to unrelated settings with no shared voice/tells.

- **Cluster:** Detective/legal self-fashioning (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Rationale:** Sherlock/detective framing + investigation/judgement language + literary allusion density.
  - **Key anchors:** Speckled Band; Baker Street; Scotland Yard; “investigator/judge” motif; “thank goodness, I was no detective”.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N12` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md): Speckled Band echo + “murder mechanics” register
    - `N16` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md): Baker Street + “investigating judge” framing
    - `N28` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md): “thank goodness, I was no detective” in violence vignette
    - `N24` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md): Scotland Yard collapse / Kursaal voice
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages clearly separate narrators/contexts for these allusions.

- **Cluster:** `N11` De’Ath (“Black Museum”) narrator (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md)
  - **Rationale:** Page 91 contains a high-signal narrator self-identification (DEATH → De’Ath/DeAth) paired with a distinctive “Black Museum” crime-collection voice.
  - **Key anchors:** “Black Museum”; “capitalise my third letter” nameplay; macabre exhibit anecdote; “Smiler with the Knife”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the nameplay resolves to a different identity, or “Black Museum” is used generically with no stable narrator signature.

- **Cluster:** Mid-August calendar hints (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Rationale:** Page 19’s “Human Comedy… beyond to-day” strongly suggests Balzac’s death date, aligning with Page 8’s Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”; Page 10 supplies nearby “Hyacinth’s day / Jasmine’s day” with an explicit 2‑day offset.
  - **Key anchors:** Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino “to-day”; “Human Comedy” “to-day”; Hyacinth/Jasmine day-names + “went back two days”.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N02` dog POV date-layer subset: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** dates don’t align when verified, or “day” terms are private nicknames rather than calendar anchors.

- **Cluster:** Mr. Hall + knob mechanism (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages feature “twiddling” a (black/polished) knob followed by Mr. Hall entering; suggests the same scene/device.
  - **Key anchors:** repeated Mr. Hall entrances; knob described as black/red vs polished.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N02` dog POV scene-mechanic anchor: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show multiple unrelated Mr. Hall contexts or different mechanisms.

- **Cluster:** `N10` Will/document eavesdropper voice (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md
  - **Rationale:** Pages 12 and 14 share inheritance eavesdropping and legal/document language (including a May-addressed “leave everything to me” frame), suggesting a possible consistent narrator signature around estate manoeuvring.
  - **Key anchors:** will/inheritance talk addressed to May; “abstracted will” pun; document-reading setup.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** May/Henry context proves incompatible across the two pages, or the will language is a one-off motif rather than a narrator signature.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N10):**
    - **Sequence A — eavesdropped will-talk → hangover document scene** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md foregrounds overheard will/inheritance talk (“leave everything to me… May”), while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md places the narrator opposite a man bent over “documents” and explicitly punning on an “abstracted will,” reading like the follow-on document scene.
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md’s spilled wine fits Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md’s “very bad head” + aspirin as plausible morning-after texture (tentative).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Page 12’s vis-à-vis is shown to be unrelated to May’s companion (different role/setting), or Page 12’s “bad head” is clearly not post‑drinking.
        - Henry’s subordinate role on Page 14 is shown to be incompatible with the Page 12 setting (e.g., narrator status/household differs).
    - **Sequence B — alternative ordering (unresolved)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md
      - **Why:**
        - If Page 12’s document scene comes first, it could prime the narrator’s sensitivity (“I would get… what I wanted”) before the later overheard inheritance beat on Page 14 (“my ears were becoming attuned… for the first time I heard clearly”).
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Any explicit “next day”/before-after marker emerges that forces one direction.
  - **Next falsification check:** require a phrase-level anchor beyond generic “will/documents” (e.g., “velvet/cinders,” topaz-searchlight eyes, Henry-as-servant in a document scene, or May addressed again) before treating this as more than a two-page motif pairing.

- **Cluster:** Wills and inheritance (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md
  - **Rationale:** Pages 12/14 centre wills/“leave everything” talk; Page 28 adds a “forging” scheme while “the woman was not yet dead”; Page 50 explicitly says “The will was there” with a man working over “strange pens”; Page 78 describes “mimic artistry” and a “soon to be dead woman’s” memorial being guided by a “falser hand”.
  - **Key anchors:** documents + “abstracted will”; overheard “leave everything to me… May”; “Forging ahead… since the woman was not yet dead”; Page 50’s caseful of pens + will-at-table scene.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N10` will/document eavesdropper: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md
    - `N39` will/forgery voice: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md
    - `N18` falser-hand forgery voice: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are unrelated conversations (different May/setting).

- **Cluster:** Nautical timekeeping register (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
  - **Rationale:** Sea setting + sailor diction; Page 11 has capstan + dog-watch time marker; Page 41 mentions “first dog” (possibly dog-watch).
  - **Key anchors:** sea/gulls/“sailor” cues; capstan bar; “second dog” watch; “first dog”.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N17` dog-watch/capstan voice: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
    - `N01` sea imagery without explicit watchkeeping: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “capstan”/“dog” language is shown to be metaphorical/non-nautical.

- **Cluster:** Cocktail-bar seduction (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages foreground a woman in a drinking/seduction setting, with strong sensory fixation and menu/venue vocabulary (“the Dawn”; named desserts/drinks).
  - **Key anchors:** “cocktail after cocktail”; cigarette; “the Dawn”; “Lover’s Delight” / Banana Split; Henry guiding narrator (Page 42); Alexander (“Ecky”) narrator voice (Page 43).
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N21` seduction + Henry-in-scene: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md
    - `N01` Ecky bar voice + dessert titles: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are separate narrators/venues and the drink/dessert titles do not recur together.

- **Cluster:** Westphalian ham + paper-reading (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
  - **Rationale:** Both pages use Westphalian ham as a table-setting while someone handles/reads “papers/bits of paper”, suggesting a shared interview or clue-reading scene.
  - **Key anchors:** Westphalian ham; “papers” / “bits of paper”; shared table/companionship.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N25` interviewer/papers voice: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Westphalian ham is merely decorative and appears across unrelated scenes with no consistent narrator/setting.

- **Cluster:** Whitman quotations (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_51.md
  - **Rationale:** Multiple explicit Whitman snippets suggest a shared narrator reading set or a deliberate “Whitman voice” motif layer (see also the Phase 3 macro cluster “Whitman quotation collage”).
  - **Key anchors:** Page 32’s Whitman “good fortune” quote + scansion talk; Page 51’s “I dance with the dancers…” and other Whitman lines.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N03` Clement voice with Whitman layer: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
    - `N31` Surrey place-pun + Whitman/botany register: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md
    - `N36` passing-through travel + heartbeat + Whitman cadence: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_51.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Whitman lines appear scattered across many unrelated narrators without other shared tells.

- **Cluster:** Plant/poison thread (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated botanical poison language (foxgloves/digitalis, calabar/physostigma, hellebore, lobelia, “lords and ladies”, gardenia taxonomy) suggests a shared narrator expertise or method thread.
  - **Key anchors:** “foxgloves” / “digitalis purpurea”; “Calabar Bean” / “physostigma” / “old Calabar”; “hellebore”; lobelia + “lords and ladies”; Cape Jasmine/gardenia precision; beans/pill + potato leaves; Page 54’s “pestle a poisoned poison” + “green blood” horticulture; Page 59’s gelsemium (yellow jasmine).
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N12` poison logistics subset: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md
    - `N03` Clement/pills/flowers subset: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md
    - singletons / bridges: `N31` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md), `N26` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md), `N06` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md), `N13` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md)
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show these are isolated metaphors with no shared voice/continuity.

- **Cluster:** “To-day” as historical date marker (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md
  - **Rationale:** Each page ties “to-day” to a specific historical event/holiday (diamond necklace acquittal; Waterloo/La Belle Alliance; a “fifth” deliverance holiday), suggesting calendar-key ordering mechanics.
  - **Key anchors:** Diamond Necklace cardinal acquittal; “meeting at La Belle Alliance”; “James… the Earl and his brother Alexander”; Francis Ferdinand’s murder reference.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N25` papers/interview date hook: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md
    - `N26` breakfast/second-sight date hook: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md
    - `N16` smell-memory date hook: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md
    - `N12` poison logistics date hook: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
    - `N15` assassination-date hook: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md
    - `N37` deceased-introduction date hook: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “to-day” references are purely decorative and do not resolve to dates or ordering constraints.

- **Cluster:** `N02` Dog POV (confidence: `CERTAIN`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Rationale:** Explicit animal-coded reactions (ears pulled, “low noise”; tail “vibration” clue; mating/banishment behaviour) plus dog-coded scene mechanics (Mr. Hall + knob/bell summons) point to non-human narrator segments.
  - **Key anchors:** pulled ears + low noise; “no vibration… of my latter end”; “lowered myself and made love”; “provided a chop for me”; “nearly fell on my nose”; “my mistress” framing + “could have howled”; coat/undercoat literalism (“inherited coat”) and “vicarious”→vicar misunderstanding; Mr. Hall + knob/bell summons; Tate sugar hoarding + “I did not entirely understand” register.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later context shows these are human metaphors (or the POV is clearly human).

- **Cluster:** `N03` Clement / pills / flowers-and-mercy register (confidence: `LIKELY`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md)
  - **Rationale:** Page 24 explicitly frames a name shared by “fourteen popes and two anti-popes” and mentions Giulio de Medici (Clement VII), aligning with the character name Clement on Page 3; Page 27 recalls “tiny Clem”; Page 32 has Henry meeting with “Clément” yesterday.
  - **Key anchors:** pope-count clue + Giulio de Medici; Page 3’s “meeting with Clement”; Page 27’s “tiny Clem”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 24 narrator is explicitly named something else later, or “Clement” is purely thematic.
  - **Phase 4 internal ordering hypotheses (N03):**
    - **Sequence A — instruction-giver / pills setup** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md
      - **Why:**
        - Both pages pivot on a key meeting “yesterday” in which the narrator receives detailed instructions for a “job” and/or dosing (“assassin’s wonderful substance”).
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md reads as a morning-after reflection at/near the appointment location, while Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md reads like the narrator is already en route (“I was on my way…”) and on pill #2.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - The “yesterday” meeting/appointment is shown to involve different people/contexts on the two pages, or the physical setting markers make the pages incompatible as adjacent.
    - **Sequence B — jasmine/house suspicion beat** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages (ordered):** (MAYBE: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md) → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md
      - **Why:**
        - Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md’s explicit “Next day…” implies a prior suspicion scene; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md ends with active suspicion (“Can she be guilty?”) and shares a botanical jasmine focus (Cape Jasmine ↔ wild jasmine) plus domestic/household texture.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - Page 24’s “Next day” is anchored to a different prior scene than Page 30’s soup test, or the “she/Caroline” cast is clearly incompatible.
    - **Sequence C — “tiny Clem” backstory (unplaced)** (confidence: `MAYBE`)
      - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md
      - **Why:**
        - Reads as retrospective character-history for “Clem” (childhood), useful context but lacking a hard entry/exit cue that ties it to the instruction or house beats.
      - **Disconfirming evidence:**
        - A later page repeats a phrase-level anchor from Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md (lock-up on the Severn; Peaberry Mysore/Blue Mountain; “hushed my brat”), allowing firm placement.
  - **Resolved check:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md shares two high-signal overlap anchors with `N13` (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md): (1) “Caroline” appears only here and as “Caroline Jasmine” on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md, and (2) the header line (“Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.”) is the original Yeats continuation that Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md substitutes (“Of the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.”). Treat Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md as **pending overlap** with `N13` and avoid using it as a sole anchor for `N03` internal ordering until disambiguated.
  - **Next falsification check:** require a second independent `N13` anchor on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md (e.g., Sanders/bay-house setting, Mithradates inoculation, “dead man’s letter,” or the same guest/patient) before moving it out of `N03` entirely.

- **Cluster:** Debts and bills (confidence: `MAYBE`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md
  - **Rationale:** Repeated debt/bill language suggests a continuity hook or blackmail/payoff thread.
  - **Key anchors:** “I always pay my debts” label; “Bills should always be met squarely”; “valuable services rendered”.
  - **Sub-strands (working):**
    - `N25` interviewer/papers voice: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show the phrasing is purely proverbial and does not recur or connect to the will/forgery thread.

## Candidate sequences

Phase 3 note: sequencing work is deferred (Phase 4+). Keep this section as a historical scratchpad only; do not extend it during clustering.

Template:

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN/LIKELY/MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_?.md → …`
  - **Why:**  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:**  
  - **Next falsification check:**  

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md`
  - **Why:** Direct sentence continuation across the page break (“hung round with … the darker works…”).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Only if a transcription artifact is discovered (unlikely given page integrity checks).

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md`
  - **Why:** Direct sentence continuation across the page break (“hung round with photographs…”).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Only if a transcription artifact is discovered (unlikely given page integrity checks).

- **Sequence (confidence: CERTAIN):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md`
  - **Why:** Direct continuation of a quotation split across the page break (“…kissed the quiet feet / Of the old bold mate…”).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Only if the quotation appears elsewhere uninterrupted (making the break coincidental).

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md`
  - **Why:** Page 74’s secrecy about “them” (bought in Leningrad from an OGPU-linked seller) plausibly links to Page 75’s unreadable “orange tinted documents”.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Them” refers to something other than documents and no shared objects/references recur.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md`
  - **Why:** Page 76 frames a named victim (“Green”) and the need to “do the thing” personally; Page 77 immediately reflects on committing a first killing.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Green” is not an in-world victim, or Page 77’s “my first” refers to something non-lethal/unrelated.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md`
  - **Why:** Both are table scenes with Henry present and a nearby dog; Page 82’s disorientation could precede Page 85’s “weary business… ended” closure.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** settings or Henry’s role clearly diverge, or another page bridges the continuity.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md`
  - **Why:** Shared “old man” thread (crucial meeting → slow death witnessed → letter/retaliation fear) suggests narrative continuity.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “old man” is generic or the pronoun targets differ across pages.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md`
  - **Why:** Both pages centre an “old gentleman” figure within a hunting/food register (deer/collops; deer-stalker) in a refined venue context.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** The two old-gentleman figures are distinct, or the settings differ (moor/outdoors vs indoor soigné venue) with no bridging continuity.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md`
  - **Why:** Page 52 sets up an interview-with-papers framed as “commentary… page after page”; Page 53 continues with an “introduced to me” subject (Sir Paul Trinder) in drink, consistent with a run of interview pages.
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the “man who entered” on Page 52 is clearly a different person/context from Sir Paul Trinder, with no sustained interview continuity.

- **Sequence (confidence: MAYBE):** `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md`
  - **Why:** Trinder appears in the interview sequence (Page 53), is “about” during a gelsemium/poisoning context (Page 59), and a bearded pseudo-scientist target is declared dead after a planned “Lover’s Delight” setup (Page 60).
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 59’s “Trinder” and Page 60’s “figurehead beard” refer to different people, or the scenes’ settings/mechanics don’t align.
