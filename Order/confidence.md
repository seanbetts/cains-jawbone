# Murder confidence ledger

Track *in-world* death/murder hypotheses separately from page-ordering hypotheses.

- Ordering/clustering lives in `Order/hypotheses.md`.
- Quotes/date anchors live in `Indexes/quotes.md` + `Indexes/research_queue.md`.

## Principles

- Only include **in-world** death/violence hypotheses here (not purely historical/allusive deaths).
- Use `Pxx` IDs when possible; otherwise use `UNKNOWN` plus a short descriptor.
- Keep claims reversible: include confidence + falsifiers + status.

## Event template

- `E01` (confidence: `0.0–1.0`; status: `active` / `downgraded` / `rejected`)
  - **Pages:**  
  - **Victim candidate(s):**  
  - **Murderer candidate(s):**  
  - **Means/method:**  
  - **Motive:**  
  - **Opportunity:**  
  - **Narrative tells:**  
  - **Evidence summary:**  
  - **Falsifiers:**  

## Events

- `E01` (confidence: `0.10`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P59` (dead man; identity unknown)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN` (death already occurred by the time of narration)
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** `UNKNOWN` (only timing detail: he spoke to narrator ~1 hour before “they came to take him away”)
  - **Narrative tells:** Framing stresses deceit (“heart… deceitful”) and a story told by a now-dead speaker; “take him away” hints at custody/institution.
  - **Evidence summary:** IN-WORLD death signal is present but agency/cause is not established on this page.
  - **Falsifiers:** Later pages clarify the “dead man” is a metaphor/allusion, or confirm a non-violent natural death unrelated to the six in-world murders.

- `E02` (confidence: `0.30`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P61` (poor old man; identity unknown)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN` (described as “done slowly to death”; could imply poisoning/neglect, but not explicit)
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** Narrator claims direct witnessing; surrounding pages suggest a “crucial meeting” and later fear of retaliation.
  - **Narrative tells:** Emphasis on time-of-night wakefulness + self-command (“collect myself”) after witnessing the slow death; later page frames a franked warning/blackmail note and the threat of being “done in”.
  - **Evidence summary:** IN-WORLD death is asserted with slow-killing language, but agent/means are not named.
  - **Falsifiers:** Later context shows the “old man” survives, the death is metaphorical, or the scene is revealed as purely recollected/hypothetical rather than witnessed.
