# Murder confidence ledger

Track *in-world* death/murder hypotheses separately from page-ordering hypotheses.

- Ordering/clustering lives in `Order/hypotheses.md`.
- Quotes/date anchors live in `Indexes/quotes.md` + `Indexes/research_queue.md`.

## Principles

- Only include **in-world** death/violence hypotheses here (not purely historical/allusive deaths).
- Use `Pxx` IDs when possible; otherwise use `UNKNOWN` plus a short descriptor.
- Keep claims reversible: include confidence + falsifiers + status.

## Confidence conventions

- Confidence is numeric `0.0–1.0`; use `Skills/cjb-phase-playbook/SKILL.md` for shared mapping to `MAYBE/LIKELY/CERTAIN`.
- Adjust conservatively (usually ±0.05 per new anchor) unless the text is explicit.

## Event template

- `E01` (confidence: `0.0–1.0`; status: `active` / `downgraded` / `rejected`)
  - **Pages:**  
  - **Victim candidate(s):**  
  - **Murderer candidate(s):**  
  - **Means/method:**  
  - **Motive:**  
  - **Opportunity:**  
  - **Narrative tells:**  
  - **Evidence summary:**  
  - **Falsifiers:**  

## Events

- `E01` (confidence: `0.10`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P59` (dead man; identity unknown)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN` (death already occurred by the time of narration)
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** `UNKNOWN` (only timing detail: he spoke to narrator ~1 hour before “they came to take him away”)
  - **Narrative tells:** Framing stresses deceit (“heart… deceitful”) and a story told by a now-dead speaker; “take him away” hints at custody/institution.
  - **Evidence summary:** IN-WORLD death signal is present but agency/cause is not established on this page.
  - **Falsifiers:** Later pages clarify the “dead man” is a metaphor/allusion, or confirm a non-violent natural death unrelated to the six in-world murders.

- `E02` (confidence: `0.30`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P61` (poor old man; identity unknown)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN` (described as “done slowly to death”; could imply poisoning/neglect, but not explicit)
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** Narrator claims direct witnessing; surrounding pages suggest a “crucial meeting” and later fear of retaliation.
  - **Narrative tells:** Emphasis on time-of-night wakefulness + self-command (“collect myself”) after witnessing the slow death; later page frames a franked warning/blackmail note and the threat of being “done in”.
  - **Evidence summary:** IN-WORLD death is asserted with slow-killing language, but agent/means are not named.
  - **Falsifiers:** Later context shows the “old man” survives, the death is metaphorical, or the scene is revealed as purely recollected/hypothetical rather than witnessed.

- `E03` (confidence: `0.35`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P72` (Green; named as “the victim”)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (narrator strongly implicated)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN` / “Compact” (term for a tool/weapon; needs ID)
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN` (moralising “duty” register; possible personal grievance)
  - **Opportunity:** Narrator frames the need to “do the thing” personally and then reflects on a first killing.
  - **Narrative tells:** Heavy self-justification; de Quincey murder-aesthetics reference; tactile aftermath (warm ankles → cold).
  - **Evidence summary:** An in-world victim is explicitly named (Green) and a first murder is confessed/reflected upon in close proximity.
  - **Falsifiers:** “Green” is not an in-world person, or Page 77’s “my first” is not a killing connected to the named victim.

- `E04` (confidence: `0.30`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (soon-to-be dead woman; will/document subject)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN` (death is implied/anticipated; not described)
  - **Motive:** MAYBE inheritance/document control (forgery context)
  - **Opportunity:** Document is being guided by a “falser hand” before the woman’s death.
  - **Narrative tells:** “Mimic artistry” + “falser hand” strongly echoes will-forgery framing used elsewhere.
  - **Evidence summary:** The page explicitly anticipates a woman’s near-future death while describing document manipulation.
  - **Falsifiers:** The “soon to be dead” phrasing is metaphorical, or the document is unrelated to any death plot.

- `E05` (confidence: `0.30`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P50` (Sir Paul Trinder)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (host narrator strongly implicated)
  - **Means/method:** aconite (aconitum) / Fleming’s tincture (as referenced) in the context of sherry
  - **Motive:** MAYBE connected to May (host wants to “do my best for May”)
  - **Opportunity:** Visitor arrives before lunch and is served drink while poisonous plant/preparation is foregrounded.
  - **Narrative tells:** “I am not incautious” + immediate move to exhibit aconitum reads like deliberate staging.
  - **Evidence summary:** A likely in-world poisoning setup involving a named target (Sir Paul) is described, but the outcome is not yet stated.
  - **Falsifiers:** Later context shows no administration/ingestion or no subsequent illness/harm to Sir Paul.

- `E06` (confidence: `0.85`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P75` (window victim; identity unknown)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (narrator performs the act)
  - **Means/method:** thrown from a window into water; LIKELY drowning
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** Victim blocks the open window and is within physical reach; narrator has immediate means to push/heave the victim outward.
  - **Narrative tells:** Self-exculpation (“thank goodness, I was no detective”); black humour (“pulled up his socks… heaved outward”); deliberate death-wish framing (“He was asking for it”).
  - **Evidence summary:** The page narrates a direct killing act with intent and an explicit “victim” label; outcome is treated as likely fatal (“with any luck, was dead”).
  - **Falsifiers:** Later pages show the victim survives, or the whole incident resolves as a quoted story/metaphor rather than an in-world event.

- `E07` (confidence: `0.20`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P82` (signature-man; identity unknown)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (narrator implies intent)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Motive:** MAYBE fear of exposure/blackmail (“good memory” + “signatures were his business”)
  - **Opportunity:** Narrator is in conversation immediately after being introduced to the target.
  - **Narrative tells:** Wordplay that reads like a literal threat (“That signed his death warrant. Well, signatures were his business.”).
  - **Evidence summary:** The page implies a decision to kill a newly introduced man, but no act or outcome is narrated.
  - **Falsifiers:** “Death warrant” is purely idiomatic or comic wordplay with no subsequent in-world harm to this person.

- `E08` (confidence: `0.25`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (woman previously “killed” by the narrator; identity unclear)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (narrator claims responsibility)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Narrative tells:** Casual aside (“she wasn’t the one I’d killed”) paired with possible non-human POV wordplay (“three more left”).
  - **Evidence summary:** The page contains an explicit killing admission, but the victim and context are not established (could be literal murder or non-human/hyperbolic usage).
  - **Falsifiers:** Later context shows “killed” refers to an animal kill/idiom/metaphor rather than an in-world murder victim.

- `E09` (confidence: `0.35`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (narrator collapse/possible death); MAYBE `P01` (Henry)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (woman present; role unclear)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN` (MAYBE heart failure; MAYBE poisoning/violence)
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** Antagonistic woman is physically present and “gloating” as narrator cannot rise; Henry is “getting out of hand.”
  - **Narrative tells:** Valedictory framing (“Good-bye, Henry”); quoted lines about withdrawing and heart-illness; Scotland Yard invoked.
  - **Evidence summary:** Strong in-world crisis/death signal at the end of a segment, but agency and the exact victim(s) are not confirmed.
  - **Falsifiers:** Later pages show the narrator (and Henry) intact and the scene is revealed as rhetorical rather than an in-world death event.

- `E10` (confidence: `0.85`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P92` (old family lawyer; Henry’s “third”)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `P01` (Henry)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN` (graphic bodily aftermath implies physical violence, but no method named)
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** Henry is described in direct proximity to the aftermath and is framed as the agent by the “third… victim” tally.
  - **Narrative tells:** Explicit victim counting (“his third”) + grotesque detail (“viscera”) suggest an in-world killing rather than a mere threat.
  - **Evidence summary:** Page 58 asserts a specific in-world victim as Henry’s “third” with physical remains described.
  - **Falsifiers:** The “third… victim” and “viscera” are shown to be metaphor/genre exaggeration, or refer to non-lethal “victim” usage (stage/medical/etc.).

- `E11` (confidence: `0.85`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P93` (intruding charlady; Henry’s “fourth”)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `P01` (Henry)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** Henry is described stooping over “cooling remains” and is framed as the agent by the “fourth… victim” tally.
  - **Narrative tells:** Immediate physical proximity to a body (“cooling remains”) makes a non-literal reading harder, though still possible.
  - **Evidence summary:** Page 58 asserts a second specific in-world victim as Henry’s “fourth,” with the body still present.
  - **Falsifiers:** The scene is revealed as embedded fiction/metaphor, or later pages show the “chardlady” alive/unrelated.

- `E12` (confidence: `0.45`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (Henry’s “latest victim” / “corpse of his own making”)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `P01` (Henry)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** Henry is seen directly over a body, with blood present, and later again over a corpse framed as his own doing.
  - **Narrative tells:** Repeated corpse/victim framing across pages suggests continuity in Henry’s role as killer (even if the specific victim is not named).
  - **Evidence summary:** Multiple pages depict Henry in immediate contact with a corpse/victim with blood, supporting an in-world death event tied to him.
  - **Falsifiers:** “Victim/corpse” language is consistently metaphorical (medical/stage), or these pages are shown to belong to different “Henry” identities.

- `E13` (confidence: `0.35`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (at least two prior “killings” implied)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `P01` (Henry)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** The narration treats Henry’s killings as established history and links them to active pursuit (police “flying squad”) and corpse disposal (“buried the corpse; only the eyes showed”).
  - **Narrative tells:** “First two killings” + “crimson list” + police manhunt reads like serial killing rather than idle metaphor, but remains unconfirmed without named victims.
  - **Evidence summary:** These pages collectively strengthen the hypothesis that Henry has multiple in-world victims beyond those explicitly named on Page 58.
  - **Falsifiers:** The “killings” are shown to refer to performances/figures of speech, or the pages are not in the same narrative strand/“Henry”.

- `E14` (confidence: `0.45`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (poor fellow who “died strangely”); MAYBE `P50` (Sir Paul Trinder; “figurehead beard”)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (narrator implies success; “parson… with his collaborator… did the trick”)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** Narrator is positioned to recount/influence events around a strange death investigation; later frames a specific “success” and a man “more dead”.
  - **Narrative tells:** Self-congratulatory “I had succeeded” + explicit death outcome language; suspicious pulpit “did the trick” phrasing.
  - **Evidence summary:** The pair of pages contains an in-world “died strangely” report and a claimed successful operation resulting in a man’s death, with Trinder a plausible (but unproven) target.
  - **Falsifiers:** The “poor fellow” death is unrelated to the “figurehead beard” claim, Trinder is clearly not the target, or the language is revealed as allusive/figurative rather than in-world killing.

- `E15` (confidence: `0.20`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `P91` (dead old man; identity unknown)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN` (death pre-dates the narrated “to-day” scene)
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Narrative tells:** Offhand reference to prior work done “for the dead old man” suggests a real past death rather than a hypothetical.
  - **Evidence summary:** Page 1 establishes an in-world dead man in the narrator’s recent past, but gives no cause or agency.
  - **Falsifiers:** Later context shows the “dead old man” is purely allusive/quoted, or is explicitly unrelated to the in-world murders.

- `E16` (confidence: `0.10`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (woman; “dead the same day”)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Narrative tells:** The page treats the woman as dead while the letter text plays with “dead and buried… still alive,” raising the chance of quotation/allusion rather than in-world fact.
  - **Evidence summary:** A death is asserted (“a woman, dead the same day”) but the surrounding epistolary material is ambiguous about whether this is in-world or quoted.
  - **Falsifiers:** The “dead the same day” framing is identified as an external quotation/citation rather than an in-world death.

- `E17` (confidence: `0.10`; status: `active`)
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md
  - **Victim candidate(s):** `UNKNOWN` (“Tom… in the matter of Jasmine”)
  - **Murderer candidate(s):** `P48` (Hal, if this is literal)
  - **Means/method:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Motive:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Opportunity:** `UNKNOWN`
  - **Narrative tells:** The voice strongly reads as non-human/naïve (chop reward), which may reduce this to an animal-kill/idiom rather than a human murder.
  - **Evidence summary:** The page contains an explicit “I killed” admission tied to “Tom” and “Jasmine”, but context makes literal human murder uncertain.
  - **Falsifiers:** Later context confirms this is animal POV and “Tom” is a cat/animal (or the line is purely idiomatic/metaphorical).
