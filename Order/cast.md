# Cast ledger

Track people as candidates with evolving roles. This file is deliberately probabilistic and reversible.

## Principles

- Use stable `Pxx` IDs from `Indexes/people.md` (do not invent new IDs here).
- Do not assume murder: only promote roles when supported by page-cited textual evidence.
- Always include falsifiers (what would disprove the role claim).
- Prefer **downgrading** over deleting so we keep an audit trail.

## Template

- `Pxx`
  - **Aliases / names used:**  
  - **Role candidate:** `murderer` / `victim` / `witness` / `unknown`
  - **Confidence (0.0–1.0):**  
  - **Supporting pages:**  
  - **Evidence summary:**  
  - **Falsifiers:**  
  - **Status:** `active` / `downgraded` / `rejected`

## Entries

- `P59`
  - **Aliases / names used:** “dead man”
  - **Role candidate:** `victim`
  - **Confidence (0.0–1.0):** 0.10
  - **Supporting pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md
  - **Evidence summary:** Referred to explicitly as “the dead man”; told narrator a story shortly before being “taken away”.
  - **Falsifiers:** Later context shows “dead man” is metaphorical, purely quoted, or refers to a historical/fictional figure rather than an in-world person.
  - **Status:** `active`

- `P61`
  - **Aliases / names used:** “poor old man”; “old man”
  - **Role candidate:** `victim`
  - **Confidence (0.0–1.0):** 0.35
  - **Supporting pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
  - **Evidence summary:** Narrator claims to have seen him “done slowly to death”; later pages suggest a connected retaliation/blackmail dynamic.
  - **Falsifiers:** “Done slowly to death” resolves as figurative or the “old man” in these pages is shown to be multiple different people.
  - **Status:** `active`
