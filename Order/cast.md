# Cast ledger

Track people as candidates with evolving roles. This file is deliberately probabilistic and reversible.

## Principles

- Use stable `Pxx` IDs from `Indexes/people.md` (do not invent new IDs here).
- Do not assume murder: only promote roles when supported by page-cited textual evidence.
- Always include falsifiers (what would disprove the role claim).
- Prefer **downgrading** over deleting so we keep an audit trail.

## Template

- `Pxx`
  - **Aliases / names used:**  
  - **Role candidate:** `murderer` / `victim` / `witness` / `unknown`
  - **Confidence (0.0–1.0):**  
  - **Supporting pages:**  
  - **Evidence summary:**  
  - **Falsifiers:**  
  - **Status:** `active` / `downgraded` / `rejected`
