## Research mindset

The text of *Cain’s Jawbone* contains extensive quotation, wordplay, Spoonerisms, and deliberate linguistic games.

- Treat apparent oddities as potentially meaningful.
- Avoid over-interpreting isolated metaphors or single-use phrases.
- Prefer corroboration across pages before committing to an interpretation.

All research should reduce ambiguity, not introduce narrative speculation.

---

## Scope and discipline

- Use only sources that would plausibly have been available to the author (≤1934).
- Do not consult solved guides, summaries, or modern analyses.
- Record all concrete research needs in `Indexes/research_queue.md`.
- Summarise findings back into indices; do not paste large excerpts.
