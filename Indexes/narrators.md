# Narrators index

Track narrator “signatures” (voice tells) as hypotheses. Narrator IDs are not necessarily named characters.

Use stable IDs (`N01`, `N02`, …). Overlap is allowed early; keep everything falsifiable.

Template:

- `N01` — Label:

  - **Likely identity (if any):**  
  - **Pages:**

## Entries

- `N01` — Aquarius pen / “Ecky” bar voice:
  - **Signature tells:** fountain-pen fixation (“mottled black and silver Aquarius”); income tied to hand/skill (“ruin my hand”); desserts/cocktails treated as titled items; zodiac/astrology wordplay; occasional Scots-dialect quotation.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** Alexander (“Ecky”); MAYBE the same narrator who sits “between the Moon… and the Dawn.”
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the Aquarius/hand motif is later shown to be shared across unrelated narrators, or Alexander is explicitly a different POV than the Aquarius-pen narrator.
  - **Notes:** Watch for recurring “Aquarius/Gemini” and “bad for the hand” phrases as hard anchors.

- `N02` — Dog POV (domestic + hunting):
  - **Signature tells:** explicit dog-coded bodily perspective (ears pulled; “low noise”; “nose” POV); mating/banishment narrative; hunting/retrieval register (Lagopus scoticus/red grouse); dog medicine ingestion (Bob Martin); secret sugar stash; self-description as a dog.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** a dog narrator (breed MAYBE Skye terrier).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** any page in this set gives an unequivocal human-only physical situation (not idiom/metaphor) incompatible with dog POV.
  - **Notes:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md has overlapping “Mr. Hall”/bell-push mechanics and self-deprecation; keep as MAYBE overlap until a stronger tie-breaker appears.

- `N03` — Clement / pills / flowers-and-mercy register:
  - **Signature tells:** transactional planning + pills/“assassin’s wonderful substance”; publisher/book-world references; plant/flower precision (hellebore, wild jasmine, roses); declared hardness (“quality of mercy… little exerted”); job/instructions framing; scansion/poetry awareness.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** MAYBE a narrator named Clement (Page 24’s pope-name clue), but Page 3 also treats “Clement” as a met person → keep pending disambiguation.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 24’s pope-name clue is proven unrelated to narrator identity, or Page 3’s “Clement” is later clearly identified as a different person from Page 24’s name-bearer.
  - **Notes:** This narrator overlaps heavily with plant/poison motifs; avoid merging on motif alone.

- `N04` — Great Lexicographer / fealty voice:
  - **Signature tells:** “Great Lexicographer” (Johnson) family-namesake framing; Ockham “razor” pun; bilingual quotations; clan/fealty language; learned allusion interleaved with personal devotion.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** a learned, socially self-situated narrator (Johnson-admirer/descendant claim).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Great Lexicographer” is demonstrated to be someone other than Johnson *and* the shared diction/fealty frame breaks across the two pages.
  - **Notes:** Treat these two pages as a stable micro-voice anchor for later clustering.

- `N05` — School colours / “the Head” / celebratory allusion-dense voice:
  - **Signature tells:** school nostalgia (fives courts, “old Hall”, “the Head”); art-name dropping (Beardsley, Rops); intense allusive “menu” of references; oscillation between mourning and celebration; bodily/identity meditation.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** former pupil/alumnus narrator; “celebration was one of my specialties.”
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** if Page 68’s “old man”/surveillance thread is shown to be a different speaker than the continuous 66→67 voice.
  - **Notes:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md also references “the Head”; keep as possible overlap with `N06` until disentangled.

- `N06` — Orator/artist + flowers/documents/OGPU voice:
  - **Signature tells:** performative rhetoric (“orator’s joys”); art-identity clue (Augustus John); French poetry; sensual “initiation” memory; secrecy/blackmail register; OGPU/Leningrad mention; failing eyesight; flower/rose fixation; Browning allusions.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** educated, cosmopolitan narrator with art/theatre leanings.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** if Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md’s flower thread is shown to be a different setting/voice than the 73→74→75 segment.
  - **Notes:** This cluster may intersect `N05` via “the Head” reference; do not merge without additional shared tells beyond that single anchor.

- `N07` — Bunny & Perry (Pro/Con) internal debate voice:
  - **Signature tells:** internal argument personified (“Bunny and Perry… Pro and Con”); tennis/rowing venue shifts; pill-taking; dense quotation-and-allusion weaving; nausea + “a thing I had never done before” framing.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown (treat as stylistic narrator signature rather than named character).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Bunny and Perry” are identified as literal recurring people rather than internal debate personae.
  - **Notes:** The phrase “hammer and tongs” is a strong anchor; watch for reuse elsewhere.

- `N08` — King (“Kipling” name-jibe) narrator:
  - **Signature tells:** self-conscious nameplay (schoolboy jibe “Kipling”); narrator sees their own name printed in a window-sign; Henry present in-scene; detective/allusion density (Holmes/Sexton Blake / Baker Street framing).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** LIKELY surname King (see `Indexes/people.md` `P99`).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Kipling” wordplay resolves differently, or the window-sign name is not the narrator’s.
  - **Notes:** MAYBE overlaps: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md (Henry + dog at table, London), Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md (Henry + Scotland Yard + collapse).

- `N09` — “Old man” slow-death / letter-blackmail voice:
  - **Signature tells:** paranoid “crucial meeting” with an “old man” + suspected eavesdropper; witnessed “done slowly to death”; franked letter/package to “the girl” discovered “in the morning”; fear of being “done in”; overheated associative wordplay around London landmarks and travel-names.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “old man” and letter threads resolve to separate contexts/voices, or Page 70’s fear/wordplay is clearly in a different setting/narrator than Page 69’s death-witnessing.
  - **Notes:** MAYBE includes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md (shared “old man” + eavesdropper setup; possible voice pivot from `N05`).
