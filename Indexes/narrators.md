# Narrators index

Track narrator “signatures” (voice tells) as hypotheses. Narrator IDs are not necessarily named characters.

Use stable IDs (`N01`, `N02`, …). Overlap is allowed early; keep everything falsifiable.

Template:

- `N01` — Label:
  - **Signature tells:**  
  - **Likely identity (if any):**  
  - **Pages:**  
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN` / `LIKELY` / `MAYBE`  
  - **Disconfirming evidence:**  
  - **Notes:**
