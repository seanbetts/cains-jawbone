# Narrators index

Track narrator “signatures” (voice tells) as hypotheses. Narrator IDs are not necessarily named characters.

Use stable IDs (`N01`, `N02`, …). Overlap is allowed early; keep everything falsifiable.

## Entries

- `N01` — Aquarius pen / “Ecky” bar voice:
  - **Signature tells:** fountain-pen fixation (“mottled black and silver Aquarius”); income tied to hand/skill (“ruin my hand”); desserts/cocktails treated as titled items; zodiac/astrology wordplay; occasional Scots-dialect quotation.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** Alexander (“Ecky”); MAYBE the same narrator who sits “between the Moon… and the Dawn.”
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the Aquarius/hand motif is later shown to be shared across unrelated narrators, or Alexander is explicitly a different POV than the Aquarius-pen narrator.
  - **Notes:** Watch for recurring “Aquarius/Gemini” and “bad for the hand” phrases as hard anchors.

- `N02` — Dog POV (domestic + hunting):
  - **Signature tells:** explicit dog-coded bodily perspective (ears pulled; “low noise”; “nose” POV); mating/banishment narrative; hunting/retrieval register (Lagopus scoticus/red grouse); dog medicine ingestion (Bob Martin); secret sugar stash; self-description as a dog.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** a dog narrator (breed MAYBE Skye terrier).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** any page in this set gives an unequivocal human-only physical situation (not idiom/metaphor) incompatible with dog POV.
  - **Notes:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md has overlapping “Mr. Hall”/bell-push mechanics and self-deprecation; keep as MAYBE overlap until a stronger tie-breaker appears.

- `N03` — Clement / pills / flowers-and-mercy register:
  - **Signature tells:** transactional planning + pills/“assassin’s wonderful substance”; publisher/book-world references; plant/flower precision (hellebore, wild jasmine, roses); declared hardness (“quality of mercy… little exerted”); job/instructions framing; scansion/poetry awareness.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** MAYBE a narrator named Clement (Page 24’s pope-name clue), but Page 3 also treats “Clement” as a met person → keep pending disambiguation.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 24’s pope-name clue is proven unrelated to narrator identity, or Page 3’s “Clement” is later clearly identified as a different person from Page 24’s name-bearer.
  - **Notes:** This narrator overlaps heavily with plant/poison motifs; avoid merging on motif alone.

- `N04` — Great Lexicographer / fealty voice:
  - **Signature tells:** “Great Lexicographer” (Johnson) family-namesake framing; Ockham “razor” pun; bilingual quotations; clan/fealty language; learned allusion interleaved with personal devotion.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** a learned, socially self-situated narrator (Johnson-admirer/descendant claim).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Great Lexicographer” is demonstrated to be someone other than Johnson *and* the shared diction/fealty frame breaks across the two pages.
  - **Notes:** Treat these two pages as a stable micro-voice anchor for later clustering.

- `N05` — School colours / “the Head” / celebratory allusion-dense voice:
  - **Signature tells:** school nostalgia (fives courts, “old Hall”, “the Head”); art-name dropping (Beardsley, Rops); intense allusive “menu” of references; oscillation between mourning and celebration; bodily/identity meditation.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** former pupil/alumnus narrator; “celebration was one of my specialties.”
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** if Page 68’s “old man”/surveillance thread is shown to be a different speaker than the continuous 66→67 voice.
  - **Notes:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md also references “the Head”; keep as possible overlap with `N06` until disentangled.

- `N06` — Orator/artist + flowers/documents/OGPU voice:
  - **Signature tells:** performative rhetoric (“orator’s joys”); art-identity clue (Augustus John); French poetry; sensual “initiation” memory; secrecy/blackmail register; OGPU/Leningrad mention; failing eyesight; flower/rose fixation; Browning allusions.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** educated, cosmopolitan narrator with art/theatre leanings.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** if Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md’s flower thread is shown to be a different setting/voice than the 73→74→75 segment.
  - **Notes:** This cluster may intersect `N05` via “the Head” reference; do not merge without additional shared tells beyond that single anchor.

- `N07` — Bunny & Perry (Pro/Con) internal debate voice:
  - **Signature tells:** internal argument personified (“Bunny and Perry… Pro and Con”); tennis/rowing venue shifts; pill-taking; dense quotation-and-allusion weaving; nausea + “a thing I had never done before” framing.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown (treat as stylistic narrator signature rather than named character).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Bunny and Perry” are identified as literal recurring people rather than internal debate personae.
  - **Notes:** The phrase “hammer and tongs” is a strong anchor; watch for reuse elsewhere.

- `N08` — King (“Kipling” name-jibe) narrator:
  - **Signature tells:** self-conscious nameplay (schoolboy jibe “Kipling”); narrator sees their own name printed in a window-sign; Henry present in-scene; detective/allusion density (Holmes/Sexton Blake / Baker Street framing).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** LIKELY surname King (see `Indexes/people.md` `P99`).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Kipling” wordplay resolves differently, or the window-sign name is not the narrator’s.
  - **Notes:** MAYBE overlaps: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md (Henry + dog at table, London), Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md (Henry + Scotland Yard + collapse).

- `N09` — “Old man” slow-death / letter-blackmail voice:
  - **Signature tells:** paranoid “crucial meeting” with an “old man” + suspected eavesdropper; witnessed “done slowly to death”; franked letter/package to “the girl” discovered “in the morning”; fear of being “done in”; overheated associative wordplay around London landmarks and travel-names.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “old man” and letter threads resolve to separate contexts/voices, or Page 70’s fear/wordplay is clearly in a different setting/narrator than Page 69’s death-witnessing.
  - **Notes:** MAYBE includes Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md (shared “old man” + eavesdropper setup; possible voice pivot from `N05`).

- `N10` — Will/document eavesdropper voice (May/estate thread):
  - **Signature tells:** legal/estate vocabulary; document scrutiny; eavesdropping on inheritance talk (“leave everything to me… May”); opportunistic self-justification (“get what I wanted”) alongside “none of my business” retreats.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown (context suggests proximity to May + a subordinate Henry, but names may vary across scenes).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** May/Henry context proves incompatible across the two pages, or will/document language is shown to be a one-off motif rather than a recurring narrator signature.
  - **Notes:** Potential thematic overlap with will/forgery pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md), but do not merge on motif alone.

- `N11` — De’Ath (“Black Museum”) narrator:
  - **Signature tells:** self-identification via nameplay (DEATH → De’Ath/DeAth); private “Black Museum” crime-collection framing; macabre exhibit anecdotes; self-mythologising criminal/detective register.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** surname De’Ath (stylised).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “capitalise my third letter” resolves to a different name, or “Black Museum” is purely metaphorical with no recurring narrator signature.
  - **Notes:** MAYBE overlaps with police/detective-allusion pages (e.g., Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md) but keep separate until shared tells emerge.

- `N12` — Calabar/digitalis poison-logistics + murder-as-genre voice:
  - **Signature tells:** poison-botany specificity (Calabar bean/physostigma; digitalis) embedded in murder logistics; darkly comic genre-aware murder framing (murder counts, pursuit set-pieces); pragmatic “try again tomorrow” planning language.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Calabar/digitalis cues and the murder-counting/pursuit voice are shown to belong to different narrators with incompatible settings/biographies.
  - **Notes:** MAYBE overlap: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md (Calabar bean + experimental plant/food poisoning register).

- `N13` — Host/guest poisoning + coastal-house segment:
  - **Signature tells:** host/guest/patient framing; poison/immunity talk (e.g., Mithradates); Yeats/Whitman quotation run; coastal-house/bay landscape shifting into visceral corpse imagery; named helper (Caroline Jasmine).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Pages 86–87 are later shown to be different speakers/settings despite the apparent direct continuation.
  - **Notes:** MAYBE overlap: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md (host + May + Henry + implied poisoning setup).

- `N14` — Babbie / Rainbow Sundae / hair-and-allusion voice:
  - **Signature tells:** rapturous hair fixation punctuated by French verse; dessert-order banter (Rainbow; Lent “second Sundae” rule); insistence on naming/attributing writers; guest watching Henry handled (cap on/off).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the dessert/Lent and attribution habits are later shown to be incidental rather than a stable narrator signature.
  - **Notes:** Keep separate from `N06` unless additional shared tells emerge beyond the single French-quotation overlap.

- `N15` — “Green” victim + Compact syringe (first killing) voice:
  - **Signature tells:** self-justifying moral calculus around a named victim (Green); explicit first-killing admission; method/tool specificity (“Compact” hypodermic syringe); date-anchoring via Spencer Perceval assassination.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “my first” refers to a non-lethal act, or “Green”/Perceval anchors resolve to separate narrators/contexts.
  - **Notes:** Do not merge into `N12` on “murder talk” alone; the tone and method cues differ.

- `N16` — St. Bruno / smell-memory + incinerator-evidence voice:
  - **Signature tells:** smell-triggered scene-shifts; tobacco fixation (St. Bruno); self-aware narration about telling/following a story; vivid brand/food list; stealth/eavesdropping register (“stealing at the doors”); evidence-destruction detail (half-burned marriage certificate in an incinerator).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 44’s smell-memory + incinerator thread is later shown to be a different narrator/context than Page 45’s proverb/menu/stealth scene.
  - **Notes:** Both pages treat Henry as a central “problem” and pivot via sensory triggers (smell/absinthe).

- `N17` — Dog-watch/capstan + Kipling-quoting punster voice:
  - **Signature tells:** nautical timekeeping register (dog-watch; capstan bar); heavy Kipling embedding (Mary Gloster / “Thy Servant a Dog”); literary name-dropping (Swift, De Quincey); punning London geography (Selfridges vs Bond Street).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the shared nautical/Kipling anchors are shown to be generic motifs reused across unrelated narrators, or the Henry relationship (husband vs teacher) proves incompatible.
  - **Notes:** This voice may be the best candidate behind the “Nautical timekeeping register” motif cluster.

- `N18` — Diary/verify + falser-hand forgery voice:
  - **Signature tells:** explicit falsifiability framing (“verify… I never travel without my diary”); document/handwriting manipulation (“mimic artistry”; “falser hand”); tool/instrument emphasis; travel-as-alibi tone.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “diary/verify” language appears elsewhere in an unmistakably different voice, or Page 78 is later shown to be quoting another speaker rather than the narrator.
  - **Notes:** Thematically overlaps the will/forgery motif cluster but should not be merged without additional shared voice tells.

- `N19` — Comic coastal punster (buttonholes/lighthouse/brand riffs):
  - **Signature tells:** comic, pun-heavy narration; branded-food riffing (Bisto/Cerebos); suspicion framed as banter; coastal peril imagery (boy tumbling into sea; ruined lighthouse); drink/poison wordplay (“Emperor’s Peg” + vitriol/applejack).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 5’s brand/initialism wordplay and lighthouse setting are later shown to be a different narrator/scene from Page 4’s church/buttonhole vignette.
  - **Notes:** Both pages treat Henry as a colourful figure and lean on rapid punning.

- `N20` — Bloomsbury/nomenclature + grim-scene voice:
  - **Signature tells:** self-conscious class register (“Bloomsbury”); fixation on naming/nomenclature and soundalike jokes; familiarity with bodies/corpses and threat/weapon cues.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the “nomenclature” focus and grim-scene familiarity are shown to belong to separate narrators with incompatible backstory (e.g., Paris night vs Grantham corpse scene).
  - **Notes:** Watch for recurrence of “naming business” and pocket/weapon gestures as stronger anchors.

- `N21` — Dazed infatuation + bar/tea imagery voice:
  - **Signature tells:** dazed, self-referential repetition (“I always…”); sensual fixation on surfaces/eyes/hair; social-table/bar settings with drink/tea naming; overt fascination with Henry (and Henry policing diction).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the “dazed” and sensual-description style is shown to be a generic motif reused across unrelated narrators, or Henry’s role differs incompatibly across the pages.
  - **Notes:** MAYBE overlaps: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md (Browning “Saul” + heightened anticipation), Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md (table disorientation + guilt/weight imagery).
