# Narrators index

Track narrator “signatures” (voice tells) as hypotheses. Narrator IDs are not necessarily named characters.

Use stable IDs (`N01`, `N02`, …). Overlap is allowed early; keep everything falsifiable.

## Entries

- `N01` — Aquarius pen / “Ecky” bar voice:
  - **Signature tells:** fountain-pen fixation (“mottled black and silver Aquarius”); income tied to hand/skill (“ruin my hand”); desserts/cocktails treated as titled items; zodiac/astrology wordplay; occasional Scots-dialect quotation.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** Alexander (“Ecky”); MAYBE the same narrator who sits “between the Moon… and the Dawn.”
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the Aquarius/hand motif is later shown to be shared across unrelated narrators, or Alexander is explicitly a different POV than the Aquarius-pen narrator.
  - **Notes:** Watch for recurring “Aquarius/Gemini” and “bad for the hand” phrases as hard anchors.

- `N02` — Dog POV (domestic + hunting):
  - **Signature tells:** explicit dog-coded bodily perspective (ears pulled; “low noise”; “nose” POV); mating/banishment narrative; hunting/retrieval register (Lagopus scoticus/red grouse); dog medicine ingestion (Bob Martin); secret sugar stash; self-description as a dog.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** a dog narrator (breed MAYBE Skye terrier).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** any page in this set gives an unequivocal human-only physical situation (not idiom/metaphor) incompatible with dog POV.
  - **Notes:** Core dog-physicality pages are Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_79.md. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md remains a `MAYBE` extension keyed by the bow continuity and “Mr. Hall”/bell-push mechanics; its “powerful glass” wording is treated as ambiguous (metaphor/naïve description or a lens used by “he” while the dog observes), so don’t use it as a decisive human-POV tell unless a later page shows the narrator operating an optical instrument directly. Wordplay on Page 8 (Bologna “sausage place”) may be a non-dog calendar anchor and should not be treated as dog-voice evidence by itself. Pages 10 and 39 lean on “mistress/coat” language and naive literalism (e.g., “vicarious”→vicar) consistent with dog POV. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md is also lower-signal on physicality (mostly overheard dialogue) but fits the daybook/date spine.

- `N03` — Clement / pills / flowers-and-mercy register:
  - **Signature tells:** transactional planning + pills/“assassin’s wonderful substance”; publisher/book-world references; plant/flower precision (hellebore, wild jasmine, roses); declared hardness (“quality of mercy… little exerted”); job/instructions framing; scansion/poetry awareness; wordplay via professional charade clues (e.g., publisher pairing).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** MAYBE a narrator named Clement (Page 24’s pope-name clue), but Page 3 also treats “Clement” as a met person → keep pending disambiguation.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 24’s pope-name clue is proven unrelated to narrator identity, or Page 3’s “Clement” is later clearly identified as a different person from Page 24’s name-bearer.
  - **Notes:** This narrator overlaps heavily with plant/poison motifs; avoid merging on motif alone. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md ↔ Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md reads as a tight suspicion-resolution beat, but Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md also overlaps `N13` (Caroline appears only here and as Caroline Jasmine on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md; Yeats “Cathleen… Houlihan” source line vs Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md’s substitution) → treat Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md as pending between `N03`/`N13` until a second independent anchor resolves it.

- `N04` — Great Lexicographer / fealty voice:
  - **Signature tells:** “Great Lexicographer” (Johnson) family-namesake framing; Ockham “razor” pun; bilingual quotations; clan/fealty language; learned allusion interleaved with personal devotion.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** a learned, socially self-situated narrator (Johnson-admirer/descendant claim).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_61.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Great Lexicographer” is demonstrated to be someone other than Johnson *and* the shared diction/fealty frame breaks across the two pages.
  - **Notes:** Treat these two pages as a stable micro-voice anchor for later clustering.

- `N05` — School colours / “the Head” / celebratory allusion-dense voice:
  - **Signature tells:** school nostalgia (fives courts, “old Hall”, “the Head”); art-name dropping (Beardsley, Rops); intense allusive “menu” of references; oscillation between mourning and celebration; bodily/identity meditation.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** former pupil/alumnus narrator; “celebration was one of my specialties.”
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** only if the 66→67 sentence continuation is later shown to be a transcription artifact (unlikely given page integrity checks).
  - **Notes:** Tightened to exclude Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md (now treated under `N09`) unless school-specific anchors recur there. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md also references “the Head”; keep as possible overlap with `N06` until disentangled.

- `N06` — Orator/artist + flowers/documents/OGPU voice:
  - **Signature tells:** performative rhetoric (“orator’s joys”); art-identity clue (Augustus John); French poetry; sensual “initiation” memory; secrecy/blackmail register; OGPU/Leningrad mention; failing eyesight; flower/rose fixation; Browning allusions.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** educated, cosmopolitan narrator with art/theatre leanings.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** if Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md’s May/eyes thread is shown to be a different narrator from the flower/documents segment (73–75/83), or if Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md’s flower thread is shown to be a different setting/voice than the 73→74→75 segment.
  - **Notes:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md is a `MAYBE` extension keyed by “red May” + eyesight trouble, with an additional low-signal inheritance/*Hamlet* echo to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md. This cluster may intersect `N05` via “the Head” reference; do not merge without additional shared tells beyond that single anchor.

- `N07` — Bunny & Perry (Pro/Con) internal debate voice:
  - **Signature tells:** internal argument personified (“Bunny and Perry… Pro and Con”); tennis/rowing venue shifts; pill-taking; dense quotation-and-allusion weaving; nausea + “a thing I had never done before” framing.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown (treat as stylistic narrator signature rather than named character).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md
  - **Confidence:** `CERTAIN`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Bunny and Perry” are identified as literal recurring people rather than internal debate personae.
  - **Notes:** The phrase “hammer and tongs” is a strong anchor; watch for reuse elsewhere.

- `N08` — King (“Kipling” name-jibe) narrator:
  - **Signature tells:** self-conscious nameplay (schoolboy jibe “Kipling”); narrator sees their own name printed in a window-sign; Henry present in-scene; detective/allusion density (Holmes/Sexton Blake / Baker Street framing); cryptic-style transforms (anagrams/insertion; 21→21:00 clock pun).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** LIKELY surname King (see `Indexes/people.md` `P99`).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Kipling” wordplay resolves differently, the window-sign name is not the narrator’s, or Page 15’s “Bart” is not the same dog as Bartholomew in Page 82.
  - **Notes:** Page 82 shares the table/Henry + barking-dog frame with Page 85 but lacks the explicit nameplay/window-sign anchors; keep it under `N08` with `MAYBE` confidence. Page 15 is a `MAYBE` extension keyed by the “Bart”/Bartholomew dog + table framing. MAYBE overlaps: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md (Henry + Scotland Yard + collapse).

- `N09` — “Old man” slow-death / letter-blackmail voice:
  - **Signature tells:** paranoid “crucial meeting” with an “old man” + suspected eavesdropper; witnessed “done slowly to death”; franked letter/package to “the girl” discovered “in the morning”; fear of being “done in”; overheated associative wordplay around London landmarks and travel-names; Café Royal/time-budgeting anchor paired with an explicit written account (“told him all, hour by hour, day by day”); occasional mythic charade for stationery/letter-writing.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_69.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “old man” and letter threads resolve to separate contexts/voices, or the Café Royal + written-confession pages (95–96) are later anchored to a clearly different narrator from the “old man” strand (68–70).
  - **Notes:** Earlier overlap with `N05` was deprioritised; treat Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md as part of this voice unless school-specific anchors recur.

- `N10` — Will/document eavesdropper voice (May/estate thread):
  - **Signature tells:** legal/estate vocabulary; document scrutiny; eavesdropping on inheritance talk (“leave everything to me… May”); opportunistic self-justification (“get what I wanted”) alongside “none of my business” retreats; legal double-definition wordplay (“abstracted will” style).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown (context suggests proximity to May + a subordinate Henry, but names may vary across scenes).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** May/Henry context proves incompatible across the two pages, or will/document language is shown to be a one-off motif rather than a recurring narrator signature.
  - **Notes:** Potential thematic overlap with will/forgery pages (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md), but do not merge on motif alone.

- `N11` — De’Ath (“Black Museum”) narrator:
  - **Signature tells:** self-identification via nameplay (DEATH → De’Ath/DeAth) including orthographic “instruction” phrasing; private “Black Museum” crime-collection framing; macabre exhibit anecdotes; self-mythologising criminal/detective register.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** surname De’Ath (stylised).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “capitalise my third letter” resolves to a different name, or “Black Museum” is purely metaphorical with no recurring narrator signature.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for the “Black Museum” + orthographic name-instruction combo in other detective pages (esp. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md) before proposing any merge.

- `N12` — Calabar/digitalis poison-logistics + murder-as-genre voice:
  - **Signature tells:** poison-botany specificity (Calabar bean/physostigma; digitalis) embedded in murder logistics; darkly comic genre-aware murder framing (murder counts, pursuit set-pieces); pragmatic “try again tomorrow” planning language; wordplay/idiom-twisting tied to botany and deception (“botulist”; “up the garden path”).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Calabar/digitalis cues and the murder-counting/pursuit voice are shown to belong to different narrators with incompatible settings/biographies.
  - **Notes:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md is a `MAYBE` extension keyed by Calabar bean/physostigma + experimental plant/food-poisoning register; drop it if “old mineralogist”/setting anchors tie it elsewhere.

- `N13` — Host/guest poisoning + coastal-house segment:
  - **Signature tells:** host/guest/patient framing; poison/immunity talk (e.g., Mithradates); Yeats/Whitman quotation run; coastal-house/bay landscape shifting into visceral corpse imagery; named helper (Caroline Jasmine).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Pages 86–87 are later shown to be different speakers/settings despite the apparent direct continuation.
  - **Notes:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md is a `MAYBE` extension keyed by the host/guest table register + implied poisoning setup; current linkage to the coastal-house segment is unsupported (no phrase-level anchor; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md’s guest is explicitly “she” vs Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md’s “Sir Paul”), so treat it as overlap-only unless a stronger shared anchor appears. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md is another overlap candidate (Caroline + Yeats source line) but lacks the coastal-house/Sanders/letter anchors so keep it overlap-only for now.

- `N14` — Babbie / Rainbow Sundae / hair-and-allusion voice:
  - **Signature tells:** rapturous hair fixation punctuated by French verse; dessert-order banter (Rainbow; Lent “second Sundae” rule); insistence on naming/attributing writers; guest watching Henry handled (cap on/off).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the dessert/Lent and attribution habits are later shown to be incidental rather than a stable narrator signature.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for a repeat of the Rainbow/Lent “second Sundae” rule plus the hair/attribution obsession (merge only if a phrase-level anchor recurs, not just dessert titles).

- `N15` — “Green” victim + Compact syringe (first killing) voice:
  - **Signature tells:** self-justifying moral calculus around a named victim (Green); explicit first-killing admission; method/tool specificity (“Compact” hypodermic syringe); date-anchoring via Spencer Perceval assassination.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “my first” refers to a non-lethal act, or “Green”/Perceval anchors resolve to separate narrators/contexts.
  - **Notes:** Do not merge into `N12` on “murder talk” alone; the tone and method cues differ.

- `N16` — St. Bruno / smell-memory + incinerator-evidence voice:
  - **Signature tells:** smell-triggered scene-shifts; tobacco fixation (St. Bruno) and other pungent “relief” smells; synaesthetic sensory metaphors (smell→colour/sound); self-aware narration about telling/following a story; vivid brand/food list; stealth/eavesdropping register (“stealing at the doors”); evidence-destruction detail (half-burned marriage certificate in an incinerator); occasional punning inside the “menu list”.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 7’s armchair-investigator framing or Page 55’s Bramley smell-chord vignette is later shown to be a different narrator/context than the St. Bruno/incinerator thread (Pages 44–45).
  - **Notes:** Pages 7 and 55 share the smell-first, self-correcting sensory register but lack the explicit Henry/Hodge anchors of Pages 44–45; keep falsifiable.

- `N17` — Dog-watch/capstan + Kipling-quoting punster voice:
  - **Signature tells:** nautical timekeeping register (dog-watch; capstan bar); heavy Kipling embedding (Mary Gloster / “Thy Servant a Dog”); literary name-dropping (Swift, De Quincey); punning London geography (Selfridges vs Bond Street); spoonerism/cryptic newspaper-title transforms (“Grundy Sapphic” → Sunday Graphic).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the shared nautical/Kipling anchors are shown to be generic motifs reused across unrelated narrators, or the Henry relationship (husband vs teacher) proves incompatible.
  - **Notes:** This voice may be the best candidate behind the “Nautical timekeeping register” motif cluster.

- `N18` — Diary/verify + falser-hand forgery voice:
  - **Signature tells:** explicit falsifiability framing (“verify… I never travel without my diary”); document/handwriting manipulation (“mimic artistry”; “falser hand”); tool/instrument emphasis; travel-as-alibi tone.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “diary/verify” language appears elsewhere in an unmistakably different voice, or Page 78 is later shown to be quoting another speaker rather than the narrator.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now. Resolved check: the exact “verify/diary” and “falser hand” phrasing appears only on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md (no repeats on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md), so keep as overlap-only until a second non-quotation anchor recurs.

- `N19` — Comic coastal punster (buttonholes/lighthouse/brand riffs):
  - **Signature tells:** comic, pun-heavy narration; branded-food riffing (Bisto/Cerebos); suspicion framed as banter; coastal peril imagery (boy tumbling into sea; ruined lighthouse); drink/poison wordplay (“Emperor’s Peg” + vitriol/applejack); sound-mixup puns and initialism/punctuation decoding (O.M./M.O. → OM).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 5’s brand/initialism wordplay and lighthouse setting are later shown to be a different narrator/scene from Page 4’s church/buttonhole vignette.
  - **Notes:** Both pages treat Henry as a colourful figure and lean on rapid punning.

- `N20` — Bloomsbury/nomenclature + grim-scene voice:
  - **Signature tells:** self-conscious class register (“Bloomsbury”); fixation on naming/nomenclature and soundalike jokes (e.g., classical name soundalikes); familiarity with bodies/corpses and threat/weapon cues.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the “nomenclature” focus and grim-scene familiarity are shown to belong to separate narrators with incompatible backstory (e.g., Paris night vs Grantham corpse scene).
  - **Notes:** Grantham is a high-signal location anchor on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md (1597 market-place conduit), which likely pins Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md’s “this very place” in the same incident; watch for recurrence of “naming business” and pocket/weapon gestures as stronger anchors.

- `N21` — Dazed infatuation + bar/tea imagery voice:
  - **Signature tells:** dazed, self-referential repetition (“I always…”); sensual fixation on surfaces/eyes/hair; social-table/bar settings with drink/tea naming; quotation-collage (Browning “Saul” + Kipling pre‑Rains verandah line); overt fascination with Henry (and Henry policing diction).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the “dazed” and sensual-description style is shown to be a generic motif reused across unrelated narrators, or Henry’s role differs incompatibly across the pages.
  - **Notes:** Page 92 shares a Browning “Saul” excerpt and the “what … next?” anticipation framing with Page 42; treat as part of this voice unless the quotation is shown to be widely reused across narrators. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md’s verandah/Rains line is Kipling (*Plain Tales from the Hills*), so treat it as detachable allusion (not a firm location anchor); its “she” remains unresolved (no second anchor tying her to Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md’s “Julienne?”), so keep it as a `MAYBE` extension within this voice. New complication: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md’s Blake excerpt (“Bring Palamabron… Elynittria”) is directly continued on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md (“Rintrah… Ocalythron”), suggesting Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md as a tighter join (treat as a potential cross-cluster quote-continuation constraint).

- `N22` — Morbid London decoder (plague quotation voice):
  - **Signature tells:** decoding/reading completion framing (“figures and letters”); London homecoming with sepulchral beauty imagery; stitched-in historical plague prose used as an immediate interpretive lens.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the plague-prose source is shown to be a widely reused quotation across multiple narrators, or the “figures and letters” motif recurs under a clearly different voice.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: if the plague-prose quotation (once sourced) recurs elsewhere in the same “decoding finish-line + sepulchral London” register, merge; otherwise keep separate.

- `N23` — Music-hall cosmetics / Highgate Empire voice:
  - **Signature tells:** theatre/music-hall venue specificity (Highgate Empire; performers/acts); cosmetics and prosthetic detail (false eyebrows; make-up artist); domestic supper detail; nostalgic tone.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** later pages show the same eyebrow/cosmetics vignette is quoted/remembered by multiple narrators, or the Henry-relation here is incompatible with other Henry-linked scenes.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for “Highgate Empire” or the false-eyebrows mishap and named music-hall acts (Wilkie Bard/Lauder) before merging with any other cosmetic-gesture pages.

- `N24` — Scotland Yard collapse / Kursaal voice:
  - **Signature tells:** narrator in physical extremis; police framing (Scotland Yard); gloating antagonist woman; Southend Kursaal landmark; buttonhole motif used as a fatalistic detail; valedictory address to Henry.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the collapse/death framing is later shown to be purely rhetorical, or “Scotland Yard/Kursaal” is a detachable allusive layer reused by other narrators.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for the combined Southend Kursaal + Woolworth’s + buttonhole anchors; do not merge into other police voices unless at least two of these recur together.

- `N25` — Quicksands-of-crime interviewer / papers voice:
  - **Signature tells:** moralising crime/innocence language; meta “commentary/ironic comment” framing; contemptuous epithets for the subject (“well-fed swine”); interview mechanics when present (door opens/shuts; “papers” handled); pointed food tells (Westphalian ham; cucumber sandwiches); money/blackmail pressure language (“Bills should always be met squarely”; “reward for valuable services rendered”).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_34.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 34’s “ironic comment” / “innocent child” rhetoric is shown to be a generic register reused across unrelated narrators, or the “interview/papers” mechanics in Page 52 are later anchored to a different narrator/setting.
  - **Notes:** Page 33 shares the debt/bills framing (“I always pay my debts”) and clandestine observation (“behind the armchair”) but lacks the explicit “interview/papers” mechanics. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md is a `MAYBE` extension keyed by Westphalian ham + “bits of paper” reading; drop it if the table scene is later anchored to a different voice.

- `N26` — “Awful and literal sense” breakfast-recapping / second-sight voice:
  - **Signature tells:** the distinctive parenthetical aside “in the awful and literal sense of the word”; morning/breakfast domesticity; insomnia + “recapitulation” framing; claimed second-sight wordplay (“Clare” → clairvoyant/clairaudient).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the shared parenthetical phrasing is shown to be a common quotation reused across multiple narrators, or the two pages’ surrounding voice/register proves incompatible beyond the single repeated phrase.
  - **Notes:** Page 54 also participates in the plant/poison “to-day” date-anchor motif; keep that separate from narrator identification.

- `N27` — Peebles mineralogy lecturer / bell-summoning voice:
  - **Signature tells:** snobbish class register (“lower orders”); bell-summoning framing with an ambivalent reliance on a skilled subordinate; academic self-positioning (mineralogy lectures at “Peebles University”); punning blackboard proverb (“Day”/“Knight” swap).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “Peebles University” and the Day/Knight blackboard pun recur under a clearly different narrator voice, or Page 9 is later shown to be a quoted anecdote rather than the narrator’s lived scene.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for Peebles University / Charles Day / Day‑Knight proverb-pun recurrence; treat the Page 29 “old mineralogist” link as cast only unless voice tells match.

- `N28` — Window-throw / “no detective” voice:
  - **Signature tells:** black-humoured self-exculpation (“thank goodness, I was no detective”) embedded in a hands-on violence vignette (tidying socks, heaving a victim out of a window); quotation-stitching (Browning + Shakespeare) used as narration rather than decoration; misheard dying-words riff (“Band, Speckled”).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the scene is later shown to be metaphorical or an embedded quotation/story recounted by a different, identifiable narrator, or the same “no detective” self-exculpation appears under an incompatible voice elsewhere.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for the exact “thank goodness, I was no detective” or “Band, Speckled” mishearing; don’t merge on generic Holmes/window props alone.

- `N29` — Post‑Vorticists / Firbank / “chamber within chamber” anxiety voice:
  - **Signature tells:** art-world framing (post‑Vorticists private view); high-society decor cues (rococo mirror; brimming jasmine bowl); biographical name-drop (Ronald Firbank in Malta); weapon/evidence lexicon (“bores”; “chamber within chamber”) tied to fear of credibility (“who would believe me?”). MAYBE overlap tell: rare “Death… fingered” metaphor + Shrewsbury lock‑up/prison “this time” hearing contrast (Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md ↔ Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md (MAYBE extension)
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the art/Firbank layer is later shown to be detachable quotation collage used by multiple narrators, or the “bores/chambers” language is proven to be non-weapon and the voice aligns better with an existing narrator signature.
  - **Notes:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md is core; Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md is overlap-only. Falsifier run (2025-12-25): no Firbank/Malta/post‑Vorticists/bores/chambers outside Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md; no Peaberry/Clem outside Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md; no third “Death… fingered” instance found. Next check: identify the source of the “Death… fingered” phrasing (if detachable quote, drop the overlap).

- `N30` — Southend “tragic fortnight” / Sonia Gordon + omelette-stab voice:
  - **Signature tells:** classical self-consciousness (“Video meliora proboque”) combined with covert observation (fixation on elbow “fossettes”) and a remembered Southend episode; abrupt violence language (“as I stabbed once”) colliding with culinary metaphor (omelette/eggs) and deliberate misnaming (Brontë for Corday in the Marat vignette).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_38.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “stabbed” is later shown to be purely culinary (cutting an omelette), or the Sonia Gordon/Southend anchors recur under a clearly different narrator voice.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for Sonia Gordon + Southend “tragic fortnight” anchors; don’t merge with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md on “Southend” alone.

- `N31` — Flecker/Whitman compost + Surrey place-pun + pill voice:
  - **Signature tells:** dense allusive weave with intentional substitution inside quotations (Flecker name inserted into a Flecker-ghazel line); Whitman’s compost imagery (“winds… not infectious”, bean/potato growth) used as narrative grounding; pill-taking + self-correction (“I had probably got it wrong… Yet it was all right.”); place-name punning (Thames Ditton/Long Ditton).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Whitman/Flecker quotation-stitching is shown to be a generic technique used across many narrators with no shared voice tells, or the pill/place-pun register aligns more cleanly with an existing narrator signature.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for the Flecker-name substitution + Ditton place-pun + pill/self-correction cluster; treat Whitman overlap as motif unless the non-Whitman connective tissue repeats.

- `N32` — “Type” classifier / gilded metaphors + Wilde-allusion voice:
  - **Signature tells:** competitive reading/interpretation framed as “harvest/gleaning”; fixation on filing/typing people as “types”; recurring gilded/metallised visual metaphors (gold/silver/green leaf); macabre social observation; stitched-in Wilde context (Jack line + Earnest epigram; Whistler-to-Oscar jibe).
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown (MAYBE Oscar-adjacent, but treat quotations as voice markers, not identity proof).
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_65.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md
  - **Confidence:** `LIKELY`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the repeated “learned in a macabre way, even distinguished” type-judgement is shown to be a reused quotation across multiple narrators, Pages 89–90’s dining/hunting vignette is later anchored to a clearly different narrator from Page 65’s reading/typing competition, or Page 62’s gold/silver dissociation proves to be an unrelated one-off metaphor.
  - **Notes:** Page 62 is a `MAYBE` extension keyed by the gold/silver separation framing + the same moralising, macabre social observation register. MAYBE overlap with other Wilde-quote pages (e.g., Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md) if the “type/classification” register recurs.

- `N33` — Medehamstede / Pasquier claret + short-story meta voice:
  - **Signature tells:** reflective travel pause (“alone at last”); claret as a quick medicinal correction; Paris anchor (Rue de la Harpe); meta-fictional stance on short stories/embraces/plot and “complete novel” magazine framing.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_72.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the magazine/short-story register is later shown to be a quoted inset rather than narrator voice, or the same cluster of anchors appears under an unmistakably different narrator elsewhere.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for Medehamstede, Pasquier’s claret, Rue de la Harpe, or “Savage Conqueror” magazine references (merge only if ≥2 anchors recur together).

- `N34` — Time-factor / Didling wordplay + antiquarian brass voice:
  - **Signature tells:** obsessive time/mortality rumination (“to-day”, “next day”, “time factor”); self-deprecating pun chains (Dolittle → Didlittle → Didling/didlet); antiquarian inscription fixation (oldest brass by the Mole); strong tea + “first pill” morning ritual.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_20.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_25.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the shared time/wordplay register is shown to be a common technique across multiple narrators, or the two pages are later anchored to incompatible settings/participants.
  - **Notes:** MAYBE overlaps with `N31` on pill-taking + place-name logic, but keep separate until a repeated phrase/anchor ties them.

- `N35` — Rupee chapter / money suspicion + wickedness anxiety voice:
  - **Signature tells:** editorial/manuscript discussion framing (“omit… too sensational”); money-driven engagement; suspicion described as a subterranean movement; menu-course metaphor built on 1 Corinthians “fishes… birds”; fear of meeting a “really wicked person”.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_18.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “fall of the rupee” is later shown to be a detachable quotation or reference reused across narrators, or the “namesake” biblical-menu joke recurs under a different, stable narrator signature.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: watch for reuse of the “omit the rupee chapter” editorial tell together with the same money-suspicion/“wicked person” anxiety register.

- `N36` — Passing-through travel + heartbeats + Whitman cadence voice:
  - **Signature tells:** “passing through” travel posture; precise sporting anecdote (All England for a thousand guineas; “twenty-nine times in ten years”); bodily self-monitoring (counting between heartbeats); exhaust-smoke simile; dense Whitman quotation cadence.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_51.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the Whitman-heavy phrasing is later shown to be a generic quotation collage used by multiple narrators, or the sporting/heartbeat anchors recur clearly under a different voice.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for the “passing through” posture plus the heartbeat-counting (“distinct ninety”) combination; treat Whitman cadence as motif unless these anchors recur.

- `N37` — Deceased-introduction + Barbara yellow-jasmine bathing voice:
  - **Signature tells:** anxious curiosity about why a “deceased” arranged an introduction; rapturous physical description of Barbara (yellow-jasmine one-piece; towel); named travel detail (Dagenham bus; converted oast-house); Nelson blind-eye/arm-loss “to-day” anchor.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** “deceased” is later shown to be a dead author rather than an in-world person, or the Barbara/Alistair/Dagenham anchors recur under a clearly different narrator voice.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for the Barbara + yellow‑jasmine bathing description and the Dagenham/oast-house travel detail; don’t merge narrators on date-anchoring alone.

- `N38` — Medical-advice payoff + “May be” pun / Quarry hills voice:
  - **Signature tells:** slow money exchange used for later identification; physicians/medical-advice framing; emphatic repetition (“He went. He went.”); Shakespeare/Stevenson/Scott allusion weave; explicit “May be. May be not.” decision pun; vivid sunset “bruise” image over the Quarry hills.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_98.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the scene is later shown to be recounted/quoted by a different narrator, or the “May be” pun and medical-payoff framing recur under an incompatible voice elsewhere.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for the Quarry hills sunset “bruise” image and the “May be. May be not.” pun; merge only if the payoff-for-identification setup repeats.

- `N39` — Wilde/Earnest echoes + will/forgery voice:
  - **Signature tells:** overt Wilde (*Importance of Being Earnest*) echoing embedded in legal-document attention (wills; “forging”); stationery/pen fixation (caseful of “strange pens”); macabre aside about a woman “not yet dead”; church/inscription noticing used as scene texture rather than pure quotation collage.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** the Wilde/Earnest material is shown to be a detachable quotation layer reused across multiple narrators, or the will/forgery/stationery cues in the two pages resolve to incompatible speakers/settings.
  - **Notes:** Thematically overlaps `N10` (will/estate eavesdropping) and `N18` (forgery/handwriting) but should not be merged without a repeated non-quotation phrase/anchor. Phase 4 ordering for Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md ↔ Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md is still `MAYBE` (no second non-quotation anchor beyond “forgery + Earnest”; Earnest fragments also recur on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_65.md).

- `N40` — Bills-in-paper / Bryant & May / Left Luggage voice:
  - **Signature tells:** bills/debt language framed through newspapers/advertising; match/fire imagery with brand-like specificity (Bryant & May); station/Left Luggage framing; dense “named writers” run used as immediate interpretive glue.
  - **Likely identity (if any):** unknown.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md
  - **Confidence:** `MAYBE`
  - **Disconfirming evidence:** Page 23 is later shown to share a stable interview/table mechanic or repeated phrasing with an existing narrator (especially `N25`), making the match/Left Luggage layer incidental.
  - **Notes:** Singleton for now; next check: search for Bryant & May matches + Left Luggage Office + the Blackwood name run; compare with `N25` only if interview/papers mechanics also recur.
