# Wordplay index

Cross-page catalogue of **synthesised** wordplay findings for quick scanning.

Rules:
- Only copy `LIKELY WORDPLAY` blocks here (from `Skills/cjb-wordplay-synthesis/SKILL.md`).
- Keep `span` exact and short; do not paste long page text.
- Always include the page path and keep entries in page-number order.

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): <one or more>
  - span: "<exact text span>"
  - best reading: "<best interpretation>"
  - confidence: low|med|high
  - why it matters: <ordering|narrator|place|date|motif> -> <one sentence>
  - falsifiers:
    - "<one>"
    - "<optional second>"

## Entries

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): orthography + reversal
  - span: "cut out the stops"
  - best reading: "O.M. (Order of Merit) ↔ M.O. (Medical Officer); remove stops from O.M. -> OM (Buddhist sacred syllable/formula)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> “initialism + punctuation” decoding style that may recur as an instruction
  - falsifiers:
    - “stops” is later used strictly in a musical/organ sense for this voice
    - no other initialism/abbreviation wordplay recurs on adjacent pages

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): orthography
  - span: "capitalise my third letter"
  - best reading: "DEATH -> De’Ath (capitalise 3rd letter)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: narrator -> self-identification marker (stylised name) for this voice segment
  - falsifiers:
    - "third letter" points to a different formatting system on other pages
    - later text explicitly gives a different name for this narrator

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): allusion + charade
  - span: "Leda and Hebe, I gave my swan a drink"
  - best reading: "Leda (swan) + Hebe (cupbearer) -> “swan a drink” = inking/filling a Swan fountain pen"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> writing/pen/ink ritual marker for this narrator segment
  - falsifiers:
    - “my swan” is later clearly literal (bird), not a writing tool
    - “Swan” never recurs as a pen/ink brand/motif elsewhere
