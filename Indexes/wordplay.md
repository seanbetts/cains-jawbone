  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): orthography + reversal
  - span: "cut out the stops"
  - best reading: "O.M. (Order of Merit) ↔ M.O. (Medical Officer); remove stops from O.M. -> OM (Buddhist sacred syllable/formula)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> “initialism + punctuation” decoding style that may recur as an instruction
  - falsifiers:
    - “stops” is later used strictly in a musical/organ sense for this voice
    - no other initialism/abbreviation wordplay recurs on adjacent pages

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): spoonerism + orthography
  - span: "Grundy Sapphic"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(spoonerism): Grundy Sapphic -> Sunday Graphic (yesterday’s Sunday paper)"
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: date -> “Turns ‘yesterday’ into an explicit Sunday-newspaper anchor for this narrator.”
  - falsifiers:
    - “Sunday Graphic” is contradicted elsewhere by a clearer newspaper reference in this narrator’s voice
    - the surrounding context later makes “Grundy Sapphic” a literal person-name

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): double definition
  - span: "coming of age hours"
  - best reading: "coming of age (21) -> “twenty-one hours” (21:00; 24-hour clock), framed via “Lyons” (Lyon, France)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: place -> supports “Lyons” as Lyon (France) and encodes a time-of-day marker.
  - falsifiers:
    - “Lyons” is later clearly a J. Lyons & Co. venue in this narrator’s context (no time-zone contrast)
    - “coming of age hours” is used literally elsewhere (not as a 21→21:00 pun)

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): allusion + homophone
  - span: "Peter Barleys"
  - best reading: "Peter Parley (Samuel Griswold Goodrich pseudonym)"
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: narrator -> indicates a literary-allusion/pun style embedded in the “menu list”.
  - falsifiers:
    - “Peter Barleys” is later confirmed as a literal food/drink brand name in a period source
    - the surrounding list items are all literal brands with no punning intent

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): anagram + orthography
  - span: "great asses of mice"
  - best reading: "great masses of ice"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> reinforces the “cold weight/pressure” image (and may hint that other odd word-boundaries hide simple anagrams)
  - falsifiers:
    - “great asses of mice” is sourced as a direct quotation elsewhere (no pun intended)
    - “masses of ice” appears elsewhere explicitly, making this reading redundant as wordplay

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): anagram
  - span: "to ladder danger"
  - best reading: "garden ladder" (via anagram of “ladder danger”; “to” may be grammatical filler)
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: motif -> keeps the gardening/horticulture register active in this narrator’s table-scene voice
  - falsifiers:
    - later text uses “ladder” non-punningly in this narrator’s voice (e.g., literal superstition about ladders)
    - a period source is found for “to ladder danger” as a fixed phrase/quotation (not an anagram)

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): orthography
  - span: "capitalise my third letter"
  - best reading: "DEATH -> De’Ath (capitalise 3rd letter)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: narrator -> self-identification marker (stylised name) for this voice segment
  - falsifiers:
    - "third letter" points to a different formatting system on other pages
    - later text explicitly gives a different name for this narrator

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): allusion + charade
  - span: "Leda and Hebe, I gave my swan a drink"
  - best reading: "Leda (swan) + Hebe (cupbearer) -> “swan a drink” = inking/filling a Swan fountain pen"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> writing/pen/ink ritual marker for this narrator segment
  - falsifiers:
    - “my swan” is later clearly literal (bird), not a writing tool
    - “Swan” never recurs as a pen/ink brand/motif elsewhere
