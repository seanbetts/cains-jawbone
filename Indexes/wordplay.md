  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): charade
  - span: "major half of a publishing firm"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(charade): major half of a publishing firm -> Stoughton (implying Hodder & Stoughton)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: narrator -> a distinctive publishing-world clue that can help cluster this voice’s business/literary register
  - falsifiers:
    - the “publishing firm” is later identified as a different firm pairing
    - “major half” is used literally (ownership), not as a clue

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): homophone
  - span: "Lesurques and mixed him up with Le Cirque d’Hiver"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(homophone): Lesurques -> Le Cirque d’Hiver (phonetic mix-up)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: narrator -> flags a pun/mishearing style that may recur in this coastal-comic voice
  - falsifiers:
    - the Lesurques/Cirque link is later shown to be unrelated to sound (e.g., two separate references)
    - no other sound-based punning recurs for this narrator candidate

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): orthography + reversal
  - span: "cut out the stops"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(orthography): O.M. -> OM (Buddhist syllable); plus reversal O.M. ↔ M.O. (Medical Officer)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> shows this narrator’s “initialism + punctuation” decoding style, which may recur as an instruction
  - falsifiers:
    - “stops” is later used strictly in a musical/organ sense in the same narrator’s pages
    - no other initialism/abbreviation wordplay recurs for this voice

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): double definition
  - span: "sausage place"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): sausage place -> Bologna (city; also sausage)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: place -> supports Bologna as a concrete setting cue inside this page’s calendar-style “to-day” anchors
  - falsifiers:
    - later evidence shows “sausage place” is a private nickname, not the city pun
    - Guido/Kilmarnock/Balmerino are shown to be non-calendar allusions in this context

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): allusion + homophone
  - span: "Day ; for the Knight cometh"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(homophone): Knight -> night, used to pun John 9:4’s day/night into Day/Knight (with assistant Charles Day)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: narrator -> stable “name-in-quotation” pun style; may help track this bell-summoning lecturer voice
  - falsifiers:
    - “Knight” resolves to a specific person/surname unrelated to day/night wordplay
    - the Day/Knight substitution fails to recur as a habit in this narrator’s pages

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): spoonerism + orthography
  - span: "Grundy Sapphic"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(spoonerism): Grundy Sapphic -> Sunday Graphic (yesterday’s Sunday paper)"
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: date -> “Turns ‘yesterday’ into an explicit Sunday-newspaper anchor for this narrator.”
  - falsifiers:
    - “Sunday Graphic” is contradicted elsewhere by a clearer newspaper reference in this narrator’s voice
    - the surrounding context later makes “Grundy Sapphic” a literal person-name

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): double definition
  - span: "abstracted will"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): abstracted will = distracted about a will + a will abstracted/stolen/abstracted"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> reinforces the will/document manipulation thread used for clustering (without implying sequence)
  - falsifiers:
    - “abstracted” is later shown to be purely emotional distraction language for this voice
    - the “will” in this scene is proven not to be a legal document (metaphorical usage)

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): double definition
  - span: "coming of age hours"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): coming of age (21) -> “twenty-one hours” (21:00; 24-hour clock), framed via “Lyons” (Lyon, France)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: place -> supports “Lyons” as Lyon (France) and encodes a time-of-day marker.
  - falsifiers:
    - “Lyons” is later clearly a J. Lyons & Co. venue in this narrator’s context (no time-zone contrast)
    - “coming of age hours” is used literally elsewhere (not as a 21→21:00 pun)

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_25.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): orthography
  - span: "Didling, perhaps"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(orthography): Dolittle -> Didlittle -> Didling (place-name hint; “at the former”)"
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: place -> a plausible place-name pointer that may become a cross-page anchor when matched with other location cues
  - falsifiers:
    - “Didling” never resolves to a place-name or recurs as an anchor elsewhere
    - later context makes the chain purely self-deprecating wordplay with no geographic intent

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): orthography
  - span: "botulist"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(orthography): botulist = botanist voice coloured by botulism/sausage poisoning"
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: narrator -> a compact “botany + food-poison” tell consistent with the experimenter register on this page
  - falsifiers:
    - “botulist” is later shown to be purely literal/technical with no punning intent
    - no other similar “near-word” puns appear for this narrator candidate

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): double definition
  - span: "led the old mineralogist up the garden"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): literal garden-leading + “lead up the garden path” deception (fits the poisoning experiment)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> a phrase-level hook that may connect to other “old man up the garden” scenes without implying order
  - falsifiers:
    - the “garden path” idiom is absent/irrelevant in this voice’s usage elsewhere
    - later context shows the “old mineralogist” scene is non-deceptive and non-toxic

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): homophone + allusion
  - span: "Caseus, ah!"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(homophone): Caseus, ah! -> Cassius (Julius Caesar), supported by the nearby “lean and hungry” hint"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: narrator -> “nameplay via soundalike + classical allusion” may be a stable voice tell for clustering
  - falsifiers:
    - Cassius/Caesar references are later shown to be absent/irrelevant for this voice
    - the phrase recurs elsewhere with a different, non-Cassius resolution

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): allusion + homophone
  - span: "Peter Barleys"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(homophone): Peter Barleys -> Peter Parley (Samuel Griswold Goodrich pseudonym)"
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: narrator -> indicates a literary-allusion/pun style embedded in the “menu list”
  - falsifiers:
    - “Peter Barleys” is later confirmed as a literal food/drink brand name in a period source
    - the surrounding list items are all literal brands with no punning intent

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): double definition
  - span: "leading the old man up the garden"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(double definition): literal garden-walking + “lead up the garden path” deception (echoes Page 29’s phrasing)"
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: motif -> a cross-page phrase-level hook (Page 29/45) for a potential “garden deception” micro-strand
  - falsifiers:
    - the phrase is shown to be generic/incidental and appears widely with no other shared anchors
    - later context forces a purely literal reading with no deception framing

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): homophone + orthography
  - span: "Clare, so both voyant and audient"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(homophone): Clare -> clair- (clairvoyant/clairaudient), used as a second-sight self-description"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: narrator -> a high-signal punning tell for this breakfast/insomnia/second-sight voice
  - falsifiers:
    - “Clare” is later shown to be a concrete person-name with no “clair-” intent
    - similar clair-/name puns do not recur for this narrator candidate

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): anagram + orthography
  - span: "great asses of mice"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(anagram): great asses of mice -> great masses of ice"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> reinforces the “cold weight/pressure” image (and may hint that other odd word-boundaries hide simple anagrams)
  - falsifiers:
    - “great asses of mice” is sourced as a direct quotation elsewhere (no pun intended)
    - “masses of ice” appears elsewhere explicitly, making this reading redundant as wordplay

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): anagram
  - span: "to ladder danger"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(anagram): garden ladder (via anagram of “ladder danger”; “to” may be grammatical filler)"
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: motif -> keeps the gardening/horticulture register active in this narrator’s table-scene voice
  - falsifiers:
    - later text uses “ladder” non-punningly in this narrator’s voice (e.g., literal superstition about ladders)
    - a period source is found for “to ladder danger” as a fixed phrase/quotation (not an anagram)

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): insertion + orthography
  - span: "whiskified objectionable was Kipling"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(insertion): KING -> K(LIP)ING -> KIPLING (name-jibe; “lip” where whiskers are)"
  - confidence: med
  - why it matters: narrator -> a plausible self-name tell (“King”) for this detective-table voice segment
  - falsifiers:
    - the narrator’s name is later explicitly not “King”
    - “Kipling” is shown to be used purely as an external author reference with no cryptic intent

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): orthography
  - span: "capitalise my third letter"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(orthography): DEATH -> De’Ath (capitalise 3rd letter)"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: narrator -> self-identification marker (stylised name) for this voice segment
  - falsifiers:
    - "third letter" points to a different formatting system on other pages
    - later text explicitly gives a different name for this narrator

- `Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md`

  LIKELY WORDPLAY
  - mechanism(s): allusion + charade
  - span: "Leda and Hebe, I gave my swan a drink"
  - best reading: "From CANDIDATE(allusion): Leda (swan) + Hebe (cupbearer) -> “swan a drink” = inking/filling a Swan fountain pen"
  - confidence: high
  - why it matters: motif -> writing/pen/ink ritual marker for this narrator segment
  - falsifiers:
    - no other stationery/letter-writing cues appear in adjacent pages for this voice
    - “Swan” never recurs as a pen/ink brand/motif elsewhere
