## Open items

- **Item:** Identify the source of “graves of the martyrs… whaups… my heart remembers how”
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor narrator voice + setting; may encode date/place.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Louis Stevenson, “To S. R. Crockett” (*Songs of Travel and Other Verses*, 1896): “Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying, my heart remembers how.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Songs_of_Travel_and_Other_Verses/To_S._R._Crockett.

- **Item:** Identify/locate “St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine”
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
  - **Why it matters:** Setting anchor for clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY a constructed/in-world institution name built from Chambers (1908) definitions: “chine” = “a ravine” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Chapman_Chrysoprase) and “Lazar-house” = “a lazaretto” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Lawk_Liebig). No specific real-world “St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine” found; treat as a coastal-setting marker + institutional hint rather than a precise map-pin.

- **Item:** Identify plague-quote source on Page 2 + the “writer” who “died to-day” (and death date)
  - **Type:** quote/date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential explicit calendar anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Quotes are from Daniel Defoe’s *A Journal of the Plague Year* (1722); “the writer… died to-day” likely points to Defoe’s death date (24 April 1731), making “to-day” ≈ April 24.

- **Item:** Identify “O my mother was loath to have her go away…” / “red squaw never came…” quotation(s)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md
  - **Why it matters:** Quote anchor that may link multiple pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Walt Whitman, “The Sleepers” (*Leaves of Grass*, 1882): “O my mother was loth to have her go away… All the week she thought of her, she watched for her many a month… But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass_(1882)/The_Sleepers.

- **Item:** Which publishing firm is implied by “Austin Freeman, Oppenheim, and Mary Roberts Rinehart” (and how “Hodder” fits)?
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a character (publisher) or place clue.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Hodder & Stoughton (publisher). The narrator has “come upon the major half” (= Stoughton) and remarks that “Hodder” was not there. All three named authors have editions published by Hodder & Stoughton (e.g., Oppenheim, *The Falling Star* (1911): https://archive.org/stream/fallingstar00oppegoog/fallingstar00oppegoog_djvu.txt; Austin Freeman, *The Famous Cases of Dr. Thorndyke* (1929): https://archive.org/stream/famouscasesofdrt0000raus/famouscasesofdrt0000raus_djvu.txt; Mary Roberts Rinehart, *The Amazing Adventures of Letitia Carberry* (1919): https://archive.org/stream/amazingadventure00rine/amazingadventure00rine_djvu.txt).

- **Item:** What is the “assassin’s wonderful substance” (period usage; hashish/other?) and why is “17,600 yards” relevant?
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md
  - **Why it matters:** Connects pill/poison thread and a precise numeric clue.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Assassin” is “properly Hashīshīn, from Hashish” and the “fedais… were intoxicated with the hashīsh” (EB1911 “Assassin”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Assassin), so the “assassin’s wonderful substance” is LIKELY hashish/hasheesh. “17,600 yards” is exactly 10 miles (1760 yd/mile), suggesting an intentional “10 miles” distance marker.

- **Item:** Identify “Maestro Jimson” and the “piled abomination” whose title is referenced
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md
  - **Why it matters:** Cultural reference might place the scene/time and cluster narrators.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “The Maestro Jimson” is Chapter XI in Robert Louis Stevenson & Lloyd Osbourne’s *The Wrong Box* (1889): https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1585/pg1585.txt. In that chapter, “Jimson” is a composer persona involved with a decayed, “weedy” houseboat/hulk used as a hiding place while awaiting a corpse, which fits the narrator’s “piled abomination” framing.

- **Item:** Identify “Emperor’s Peg” (period recipe/associations)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Why it matters:** Drink/poison motif; could recur as continuity hook.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Peg” is a period term meaning “a drink of spirits” (Webster 1913: https://www.websters1913.com/words/Peg). “Applejack” is “cider brandy… derived by distillation from fermented cider” (New International Encyclopædia, 1905, “Cider”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Cider). “Vitriol” can mean sulphuric acid (“oil of vitriol”) or a metal sulphate (Webster 1913: https://www.websters1913.com/words/Vitriol). No independent pre-1934 recipe found for the named drink; treat “Emperor’s Peg” as an in-world “peg” being used as a poison delivery vehicle in Henry’s “equal parts” variant.

- **Item:** Interpret “cut out the stops” + “vaguely Buddhistic”
  - **Type:** term/quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely points to a specific text/phrase or decoding instruction.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The “stops” are the periods in “O.M.”; cutting them out yields “OM”, matching “vaguely Buddhistic” (cf. “Om mani padme hum” described as “a sacred formula in Buddhism” in *The New International Encyclopædia* (1905): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Om_Mani_Padme_Hum). The nearby “couple of letters” and Thomas Hardy/doctor-uncle reversal support O.M. ↔ M.O.

- **Item:** What are the “couple of letters” being “paraded… for all to see”?
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Why it matters:** Possible monogram/signage/initials clue for identifying a person/place.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “O.M.” (Order of Merit), explicitly framed via “Thomas Hardy had been” (Order of Merit described in *The New International Encyclopædia* (1905): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Merit,_Order_of). “my doctor uncle in the war had been just the reverse” reads as M.O. (Medical Officer), reinforcing the O.M./M.O. reversal and setting up OM once the “stops” are removed.

- **Item:** Identify the Troilus & Cressida “winter… lips of Cressida” quotation used on Page 6
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md
  - **Why it matters:** Precise-source anchor and possible encoding of a speaker/scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Shakespeare, *Troilus and Cressida* 4.5 — Achilles: “I’ll take what winter from your lips, fair lady: / Achilles bids you welcome.”

- **Item:** What is “Electric Febrifuge” and what “active ingredient” is implied?
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a drug/poison thread or period product clue.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Electric febrifuge” is a name for **gelseminum / gelsemium** (Carolina jessamine), a nerve-poison drug; its active alkaloids include **gelsemine** (and gelseminine). Murrell, *What to Do in Cases of Poisoning* (1884) lists “Electric febrifuge” under “Gelseminum” (p. 120): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NnQFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA120&dq=%22electric+febrifuge%22&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=8&source=gbs_api. EB1911 “Gelsemium” describes gelsemine/gelseminine and the drug’s nerve-toxin effects: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_11.djvu/577.

- **Item:** What is meant by “a Jew’s lime” (and why it provides relief)?
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md
  - **Why it matters:** Odour/remedy motif; could be a specific product or slang.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Jew’s‑lime” (Hort.) is a grafting wax “composed of black pitch, turpentine, &c., burnt till the volatile parts are evaporated,” used “for engrafting” (strong smell fits “concomitant odour”). Crabb, *A Technical Dictionary…* (1851) p. 507: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JL9BAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA507&dq=%22Jew%27s+-+lime%22+engrafting&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Is “Charles Victor Hugo Renard-Beinsky” a traceable person/pseudonym or an allusive composite?
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might identify narrator/character via initials or literary references.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Renard‑Beinsky is a character (Charles Renard‑Beinsky) in Menyhért Lengyel’s play **Taifun** (1910) / **Typhoon** (1913), matching Page 7’s “rereading Typhoon” and “investigating judge” framing. Google Books snippet shows dialogue with “Monsieur Renard‑Beinsky” in Lengyel, *Typhoon* (1913): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fvY1AQAAIAAJ&q=%22Renard-Beinsky%22&dq=%22Renard-Beinsky%22&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api; and gives “Renard‑Beinsky: Charles” in Lengyel, *Taifun* (1910): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_TpIAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Renard-Beinsky%22&dq=%22Renard-Beinsky%22&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=10&source=gbs_api. Treat “Victor Hugo” in CJ as likely extra allusive middle names rather than a separate real person.

- **Item:** Confirm what “Guido… on the sausage place” refers to (likely Guido Reni + Bologna) and the intended date
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential explicit calendar anchor for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Guido” is likely Guido Reni (Italian painter) and “sausage place” is a Bologna pun; Guido Reni died in Bologna on 18 August 1642 → “to-day” ≈ Aug 18.

- **Item:** Confirm Kilmarnock + Balmerino reference and the intended date (“lost their heads”)
  - **Type:** date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential calendar anchor that may pair with “Guido” on the same “to-day”.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock, and Arthur Elphinstone, 6th Lord Balmerino, were executed by beheading on 18 August 1746 → corroborates “to-day” ≈ Aug 18.

- **Item:** Identify the knob/mechanism and action sequence (Page 8 “black knobby thing”; Page 19 “polished knob”) and who Mr. Hall is
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Why it matters:** Mechanical/scene clue that likely connects pages and may identify setting/profession.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** A household/service call-bell (bell-push/knob): it’s “twiddled” to ring and summon a servant; Mr. Hall is the responding “lower orders” man/servant who enters when the bell is rung (cf. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md opening: “The sound of the bell…”).

- **Item:** Identify which date “Hyacinth’s day” refers to (St. Hyacinth)
  - **Type:** date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md
  - **Why it matters:** Explicit calendar offsets (“went back two days”) could support ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Chambers’ *Book of Days* lists “St Hyacinth, confessor, 1257” under **August 16** → likely “Hyacinth’s day” = **Aug 16**. Corroboration: *Catholic Encyclopedia* (1913), “St. Hyacinth” gives “Feast, 16 Aug.”

- **Item:** Identify what “Jasmine’s day” refers to (and whether it’s a calendar anchor)
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md
  - **Why it matters:** The text contrasts it with “Hyacinth’s day” (“too late for Jasmine’s day”) and includes an explicit “went back two days” offset.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Not found as a named day/feast in Chambers’ *Book of Days*; may be an in-world/personal “day”, a name-day not covered by Chambers, or a different day-name system. Keep unresolved until a ≤1934 source is identified.

- **Item:** Identify “Gourdoulis” (Egyptian cigarettes)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md
  - **Why it matters:** Brand/product clue that recurs and may link scenes (class/period tell).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** A branded line of “Egyptian Cigarettes,” advertised as manufactured in **Alexandria, Egypt** (e.g., advert in *To-day* (1897) p. 86: “Gourdoulis’ Egyptian Cigarettes… (Factory: Alexandria, Egypt)”: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=unhNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA86&dq=Gourdoulis+Egyptian+cigarettes&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api). Also appears in UK retail price lists (e.g., Whiteley, *General Price List* (1913) p. 1201 lists “Gourdoulis & Co. (Alexandria)” Egyptian cigarettes): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IyJFAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1201&dq=Gourdoulis+Egyptian+cigarettes&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Identify “Etam dawn mist, ten inches” (product + measure)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md
  - **Why it matters:** Gift/retail clue; shade/size language may recur or locate a shopping context.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Etam is associated with stockings/hosiery (e.g., *The British Market for Hosiery* (1927) p. 8 discusses a French hosiery firm trading as “Etam”: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h8-YuNzprAIC&pg=PA8&dq=Etam+stockings&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api). “dawn mist” reads like a shade/colour name; “ten inches” likely a sizing/measurement spec, but the exact product description/sizing scheme has not yet been pinned to a ≤1934 catalogue.

- **Item:** Identify what “Orchard” and “Ravager” refer to in the Page 11 nautical passage
  - **Type:** place/name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor a specific quotation, ship, or location (supports clustering and ordering).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Direct quotation from Rudyard Kipling, “Thy Servant a Dog” (1930): “waited in Orchard, where he cast up blinded that night… my true friend Ravager… short legs…” (Google Books snippet): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hnwHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PT1&dq=%22waited+in+Orchard%22+Ravager&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api. “Orchard” is a place-name within the story; “Ravager” is the dog narrator’s friend (another dog), not a real-world ship/place anchor.

- **Item:** What is “the Grundy Sapphic of yesterday”?
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might identify a publication/poem used as a time/date anchor (“yesterday”).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY a wordplay pointer to the Sunday newspaper **Sunday Graphic** (often styled “Sunday Graphic and Sunday News”), i.e. “yesterday’s” Sunday paper. Willing’s *Press Guide* (1934) lists “SUNDAY GRAPHIC AND SUNDAY NEWS”: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Ms5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA211&dq=%22Sunday+Graphic%22+%22Sunday+Pictorial%22&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Identify “The golden one is gone from the banquets… beloved of Atimetus” (and correct Atimetus/Admetus)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md
  - **Why it matters:** Quote anchor in will/inheritance thread; could encode identity/date.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Greek Anthology epigram “On Claudia Homonoea” (author unknown): Homonoea is described as “more golden than the Cyprian… at revellings and feasts” and she leaves tears to **Atimetus** (a distinct name, not Admetus). See J.W. Mackail, *Select Epigrams from the Greek Anthology* (1890), Epigram XLIII: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2378

- **Item:** Clarify the Noel Coward “King Charles’s Head” reference on Page 12
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md
  - **Why it matters:** May be a precise allusion that clusters narrator voice or anchors a source text.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “King Charles’s head” is a Dickens allusion/idiom for a fixed idea/obsession (Mr. Dick in *David Copperfield* repeatedly returns to King Charles I’s head); Page 12 uses it as a pun on having “a very bad head” and taking aspirin. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766

- **Item:** Identify which market place has a conduit dated 1597
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strong location anchor for clustering and travel constraints.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Grantham, Lincolnshire — EB1911 “Grantham” states: “A conduit dating from 1597 stands in the wide market-place.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Grantham

- **Item:** What is meant by “Newdigate fringe” (Page 13)?
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be an identifying class/profession clue or period slang.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Newdigate” refers to the Oxford University “Newdigate” prize for English verse; “Newdigate fringe” reads as a Bloomsbury/poet stereotype label for the man’s hairstyle/appearance. EB1911 “Newdigate, Sir Roger”: “The ‘Newdigate’ prize … for English verse … at Oxford University.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Newdigate,_Sir_Roger

- **Item:** Identify Janetta Sheringham (real-person reference vs in-world character)
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md
  - **Why it matters:** Recurrence could link narrators/social circles; might be a disguised allusion.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No clear pre-1934 external match found yet for the exact name “Janetta Sheringham” (checked Wikisource search + Google Books keyword search). Treat as an in-world acquaintance until recurrence provides more anchors.

- **Item:** Identify John Hewit + Sarah Drew lightning incident (date/place) and the letter-writer (narrator’s namesake)
  - **Type:** date/place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely explicit calendar anchor (“on that very day”) and narrator identity clue (“namesake”).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** John Hewit and Sarah Drew were killed by lightning at harvest-work in a barley field on **the last day of July 1718** (July 31), commemorated at **Steeple Ashton**; Alexander Pope wrote an epitaph for them, and the event is described in a **letter by John Gay** (injury details match Page 15). Sources: Chambers, *The Book of Days* (July 31 “Lightning” entry) (Google Books full view: https://books.google.com/books?id=VEcJAAAAIAAJ); *The Gentleman’s Magazine* (1820) note on Steeple Ashton: https://books.google.com/books?id=mQaXYqwaZxgC

- **Item:** What does “Lyons” refer to on Page 15 (city vs Lyons tea-shop/Corner House)?
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor geography/time zone (or link to other “Lyons”/Lesurques references).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY Lyon, France (English “Lyons”), supported by the adjacent “coming of age hours” = 21:00 (24-hour clock pun: “coming of age” = 21) and EB1911 “Lyons (Fr. Lyon), a city of eastern France…” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Lyons

- **Item:** Identify the lyric “fondly sae did I o’ mine” (music-hall context)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor performer/repertoire and help date or cluster narrator.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Burns, “The Banks o’ Doon” — “And ilka bird sang o’ its luve, / And fondly sae did I o’ mine.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Burns%27_Popular_Songs/The_Banks_o%27_Doon

- **Item:** What/where are “the Moon” and “the Dawn” in Page 17 (venues/landmarks)?
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md
  - **Why it matters:** Physical setting anchor for the tea/meeting scene.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Text strongly suggests **named venues/buildings** (“visiting the Moon… to-day”; “Why go to pubs?”), but no specific real-world location has been identified yet. Note: “the Dawn” also appears on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md in a list of titled items (“Lover’s Delight”, “Banana Split”, “the Dawn”), so “Dawn” may be a venue name in some contexts and a menu/drink title in others; keep ambiguous until more anchors recur.

- **Item:** Identify “Moning” (tea name/brand?) referenced alongside Lapsang
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md
  - **Why it matters:** Product clue that may recur or locate the scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Moning” is an attested tea type in 19th-century tea-trade literature (often discussed as a blending tea for hard water and described as having a “tarry flavour”). See *Catalogue of Teas…* (1852) p. 79: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnUoM7KV1LsC&pg=PA79&dq=Moning+tea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api; also discussed as “Moning or Ningchow tea” in *A Short Account of Tea and the Tea Trade* (1878) p. 83: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V4ZPAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA83&dq=Moning+tea&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Identify the “namesake” quotation about dinner courses (soup → fish → birds) and the epigram line on Page 18
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_18.md
  - **Why it matters:** Namesake identification could pin the narrator; may connect to other epigram references.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “another of fishes… another of birds” is from **1 Corinthians 15:39** (KJV): “another of fishes, and another of birds” → Page 18 turns it into a menu-courses joke (adds “soup” ahead of the biblical “fishes… birds”), making the “namesake” LIKELY **St Paul**. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/1_Corinthians. The “epigram” cue is LIKELY the proverb “Many a true word is spoken in jest,” attested in Chaucer: “Ful ofte in game a sooth I have herd seye” (*Canterbury Tales*, ed. Skeat, “Monk”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Canterbury_Tales_(ed._Skeat)/Monk.

- **Item:** Confirm whether “Human Comedy… beyond to-day” is intended as a Balzac death-date anchor
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strengthens the mid-August calendar chain with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Yes — “Human Comedy” points to Balzac’s *La Comédie humaine*; Balzac died 18 August 1850, so “to-day” is likely Aug 18 and corroborates the Aug 18 chain.

- **Item:** Identify the queen quotation (attributed to Wotton) and what “only just come to Falkland” refers to
  - **Type:** quote/place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could uniquely identify a queen/scene and link pages by historical context.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Quote is Sir Henry Wotton, “You meaner Beauties of the Night” (“On his Mistris, the Queen of Bohemia”): “By Vertue first, then Choyce a Queen… Th’ Eclypse and Glory of her kind.” (text reproduced in E. R. Eddison, *The Worm Ouroboros* (1922), ch. 30): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Worm_Ouroboros/Chapter_30. The “queen” is Elizabeth Stuart (Queen of Bohemia); “only just come to Falkland” likely alludes to her being born at Falkland Castle (Fifeshire/Fife) on 19 Aug 1596 (DNB): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Elizabeth_(1596-1662).

- **Item:** Confirm the “oldest brass in England” inscription (Sir John/Iohan Daubernoun) and its location (by the River Mole)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_20.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strong location anchor for ordering/travel constraints.

  - **Result:** The inscription matches the marginal Norman‑French text on the brass of Sir John d’Aubernoun (c. 1277) at Stoke d’Abernon church, Surrey, described as the earliest extant English brass. Sources: Fox-Davies, *A Complete Guide to Heraldry* (1909), ch. 4: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry/Chapter_4 ; EB1911 “Brasses, Monumental”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Brasses,_Monumental ; EB1911 “Surrey”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Surrey (also notes the River Mole as a chief Surrey river, consistent with “by the Mole”).

- **Item:** Interpret the poison/medical language around “proved digitalis purpurea… a signal wash out” and “Calabar Bean”
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a poisoning method and link to other plant/drug narrators.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** EB1911 confirms digitalis (foxglove leaves; *Digitalis purpurea*) as a cardiac drug and a “powerful diuretic” in small/moderate doses, which fits “signal wash out”; it is also described as a cumulative poison. Calabar bean is the seed of *Physostigma venenosum* (“ordeal bean” of Old Calabar), containing the alkaloid physostigmine (eserine), a potent and poisonous drug with marked antagonism to atropine. EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Digitalis ; https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Calabar_Bean

- **Item:** Identify “John and Cornelius, the Dort people” + the “good one in prison” whose birthday is referenced
  - **Type:** date/name
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential calendar anchor (“that day”) and a murder allusion that may recur.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** John and Cornelius “the Dort people” are Johan (John) de Witt (born at Dort on 24 Sept 1625) and his elder brother Cornelius de Witt; Cornelius is the one “in prison” (Gevangenpoort, Aug 1672) in the account of their lynching. A period biography gives Cornelius’s birthdate as 15 June 1623 (Parieu, *John de Witt; or, twenty years’ interregnum…* 1858, Google Books: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PnlZAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA7).

  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md
  - **Why it matters:** Spans pages and likely anchors an Irish-themed source.

  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a precise literary/historical allusion (matchgirls) used for dating/clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Page 23 blends match imagery with Oscar Wilde’s “Requiescat” (“Tread lightly, she is near / Under the snow” → “Rub gently, she is here, under the snow”) and Francis Thompson’s “Dream-Tryst” (“Nor can her eyes go out”), plus a biographical nod that Thompson “earn[ed] a few pence by selling matches” (Catholic Encyclopedia, 1913).

- **Item:** Who are Fidelia Faustina Flora Blackwood and Ebenezer Blackwood, and what is the “Left Luggage Office” reference?
  - **Type:** name/place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md
  - **Why it matters:** Names may hide a clue (animal pedigree vs people); Left Luggage Office may be a scene anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** No clear pre-1934 external “Blackwood siblings” reference found; the given names do have explicit meanings in Chambers (1908) “Christian Names” (Fidelia = faithful; Faustina = fortunate; Flora = flowers; Ebenezer = “stone of help”), suggesting deliberate name-choice/wordplay. “Hocks” supports an animal reading (Chambers 1908: hough/hock = hind-leg joint of a quadruped). “Left Luggage Office” is railway-station luggage storage/office (e.g., *When William Came*, Chapter II: “booking office, left-luggage office…”). Sources: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/The_More_Common_English_Christian_Names ; https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Holywell_Hurry ; https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/When_William_Came/Chapter_II

  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a narrator/character and link to other Clement mentions (Page 3).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** EB1911 “Clement” opens “the name of fourteen popes and two anti-popes,” matching the Page 24 formulation and supporting “Clement” as a deliberate name clue. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Clement

- **Item:** Identify the Ahkoond of Swat reference and whether it links to other pages
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential shared-allusion anchor for narrator clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Ahkoond/Akhund of Swat” refers to the Akhund of Swat, Abdul Ghafur (1794–1877), a religious leader who held long “religious dominance” in Swat. EB1911 “Swat”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Swat

- **Item:** Identify the “gone the same way home” song and why “to-day” is asserted alongside Jeremy Taylor + Eugene Sue
  - **Type:** quote/date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_25.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a precise date anchor and a place-name hint (Didling).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Likely refers to the old song “All Go the Same Way Home” (song-title discussed in *The Literary Digest*, 1914: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GFENffy9hgwC&pg=PA890&vq=%22All+Go+the%22). “to-day” may be intended as a 3 Aug calendar hook via Eugène Sue’s death date (3 Aug 1857, EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Sue,_Eug%C3%A8ne) and Jeremy Taylor’s fever onset on 3 Aug 1667 (*The Living Age*, 1871: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FaRIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA8), though Taylor’s death date is 13 Aug 1667 (EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Taylor,_Jeremy). Didling is a real Sussex place (e.g., “Didling Hill, above Didling” in *Highways and Byways in Sussex*, Chapter 2: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Highways_and_Byways_in_Sussex/Chapter_2).

- **Item:** Identify “Ben Wade” (and why Hodge asks about him) on Page 26
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a character/allusion used as a recognition test or date anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Likely refers to a Ben Wade tobacco pipe (brand) rather than a person; e.g., *Life* (1912) runs an advert: “What could be sweeter than a Ben Wade pipe?” https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oE6vVC1I8TYC&pg=PA1&vq=%22Ben+Wade%22

- **Item:** What is meant by “like a bee with a sore bonnet” (“foreign touch”) on Page 26?
  - **Type:** term/quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a specific idiom/source that clusters narrator voice.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Likely a “foreign touch”/malapropism of the idiom “bear with a sore head” (e.g., Kipling, *The Light That Failed*, Ch. 12: “cheerful as a bear with a sore head”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Light_That_Failed/Chapter_12).

- **Item:** Identify the “county town on the Severn” lock-up allusion on Page 27 (and what “tapping” case/story it is)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor a specific location and link to a known case/story.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “County town on the Severn” most likely points to Shrewsbury (county town of Shropshire; situated on the river Severn) (EB1911 “Shrewsbury”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Shrewsbury). The “tapping… at the very walls… sign of a breach” reads as Death-as-burglar metaphor; no specific named “tapping case” source identified.

- **Item:** Identify the 1917 “tenth edition” book in Page 28 (device: “single star above what was perhaps a sea”)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md
  - **Why it matters:** Book/publisher device likely identifies narrator reading and may anchor place/time.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The passage quotes Oscar Wilde’s *The Importance of Being Earnest* (Act I, Lane: “I have only been married once… misunderstanding… No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject…”) https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest/Act_I. The “single star above… sea” device is likely the publisher’s imprint/series mark but is not yet independently corroborated.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “No, Sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it myself.” (Page 28)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md
  - **Why it matters:** Distinctive line might identify a speaker/source text and help cluster pages.

  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md
  - **Why it matters:** Supports the plant/poison method thread and may identify the narrator’s knowledge.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Lobelia” likely refers to *Lobelia inflata* (“Indian tobacco”); EB1911 describes lobelia as “a typical respiratory poison” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Lobelia). “Lords and ladies” is a common name for *Arum maculatum* (cuckoo-pint / wake robin); EB1911 notes aroids contain an “acrid poisonous juice” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Aroideae). “The broad ones” are most likely broad beans (*Vicia faba*), contrasted with West African ordeal beans/physostigma (EB1911 “Bean”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bean).

- **Item:** Identify the “old mineralogist” on Page 29 (is this a known character elsewhere?)
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could connect to the Peebles/mineralogy narrator (Page 9) and support ordering/clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** No unique external identification found from the term alone; treat as an in-world, unnamed person (`P35`) and track for naming/recurrence. Possible continuity hook: “led… up the garden” phrasing also appears on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md; mineralogy is a strong profession-tell on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “this savours not of death, this hath a relish of eternity” (Page 30)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md
  - **Why it matters:** Quote used as a probe/test; may uniquely identify author and connect scenes.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** William Watson, “The Sovereign Poet” (in *The Collected Poems of William Watson*, 1899): the poem includes “This savours not of death, / This hath a relish of eternity.” (Google Books scan: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vidXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA166&dq=%22savours+not+of+death%22)

- **Item:** Identify the “jocund maker / De Mauves / Gressie” passage flagged “by James!” on Page 30
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor a specific author (“James”) and provide strong clustering evidence.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Louis Stevenson, *Underwoods* (1887), poem “Henry James”: “Lo, how these fair immaculate women walk / Behind their jocund maker… Slighted De Mauves… Gressie…” (Wikisource: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Underwoods/Henry_James). The “by James!” probe likely points to the poem’s title.

- **Item:** Confirm which “Gainsborough” is meant by “gone out to-day” and what date it implies
  - **Type:** date/name
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential explicit calendar anchor for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788); EB1911 notes his cancer “proved fatal on the 2nd of August” (1788) → “to-day” is likely **Aug 2**.

- **Item:** Identify the Wodehouse “drooping like a wet sock” Earl quote (and which Earl/scene)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could pin the narrator’s reading source and link pages using the same passage.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** P. G. Wodehouse, *Leave It to Psmith* (1923), “Dark Plottings at Blandings Castle” (opening) — Earl of Emsworth “drooping like a wet sock…”.

- **Item:** Identify Chesterton’s “hemp at both ends” line and what “it” refers to
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might clarify narrator’s “job” implication (hanging/rope/murder).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** G. K. Chesterton, *The Flying Inn* (1914), Chapter XXII — in a discussion of hashish: “I think it’s hemp at both ends” (hempen drink → murder → hempen rope).

- **Item:** Identify the quoted letter on Page 33 (“I had yours but yesterday… dated the third of February… departed spirits…”) and what “dead the same day” refers to
  - **Type:** quote/date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a strong source/date anchor and link to other letter/“alive but dead” motifs.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (published letters from the Constantinople period): “I had yours but yesterday, though dated the third of February, in which you suppose me to be dead and buried… I look upon my present circumstances to be exactly the same with those of departed spirits…” https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SYktgDb_eXQC&pg=PA100&dq=%22I+had+yours+but+yesterday%22. The Page 33 framing “a letter from a woman, dead the same day” most likely refers to the in-world woman whose effects include the letter, creating irony against the excerpt’s “still alive” claim (not a distinct external death-date anchor from this snippet alone).

- **Item:** What are the “little bits of stuff like black pineapple” on Page 33?
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might identify tobacco/food clue tied to Gourdoulis and the debt label.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY loose dark tobacco spilled from the opened/handled cigarette box (Gourdoulis); “pine-apple” can be used for “fir-cone” in older English, which fits the cone-like comparison (EB1911 “Heraldry”: “armorists have not surrendered this, our ancient word for the ‘fir-cone,’ to the foreign ananas”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Heraldry).

- **Item:** Interpret Page 31’s “Caseus, ah!” / “nomenclature business” (Cassius pun?) and the “rill and corncrake” sound duet
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might encode a specific source or identify a mechanical/vehicle scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Caseus, ah!” is a Cassius soundalike using Latin *caseus* (“cheese”), reinforced by the nearby Julius Caesar allusion “nothing lean or hungry here” (Cassius’s “lean and hungry look”). The “rill and corncrake” duet reads as metaphor for speeding: smooth running/“rill” vs a warning “crake/creak” (like an over-driven oak about to fall), i.e., competing vehicle/engine sounds rather than literal nature.

- **Item:** Identify the “awful night in Paris” reference on Page 31 (if it corresponds to a known event/source)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a repeatable historical anchor for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** No unique external event/source match identified from the wording alone; treat as narrator backstory and revisit only if Paris is tied to a more specific date/name elsewhere.

- **Item:** Identify Wellington Crisp and the “alas, poor Richard! Alas, poor Thomas!” allusion in the Henry manhunt scene
  - **Type:** name/quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might reveal a specific source text being pastiched (and anchor character identity).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** No external identification found for Wellington Crisp from the name alone; treat as an in-world detective/pastiche figure unless later anchored elsewhere. The “alas, poor Richard! Alas, poor Thomas!” line is a mixed quotation: Shakespeare, *Richard II* (York: “Alas, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?”) + Dryden, *The Mistaken Husband* (“Alas poor Thomas, we must all die!”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9kVwN_5fp_wC&pg=RA1-PA131&dq=%22alas,+poor+Richard%22 ; https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SxAcGP1I6TkC&pg=PA610&dq=%22alas,+poor+Thomas%22

- **Item:** Identify the “good uncle… father of your fortune… longed for this alliance” line in Page 36
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify an embedded source voice and link other pages quoting it.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The line is from Alfred, Lord Tennyson, “The Sisters” (“Your good uncle, whom you count the father of your fortune, longs for this alliance…”). *Cain’s Jawbone* shifts the tense (“longed”). https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O539WMK95hsC&pg=PA461&dq=%22father%20of%20your%20fortune%22

- **Item:** Confirm whether Page 36’s “old Calabar” failure refers to Calabar bean/physostigma poisoning logistics
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strengthens the plant/poison method thread and timing (“give him another day”).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Old Calabar” plausibly points to Calabar bean (*Physostigma venenosum*), a West African ordeal poison and source of physostigmine (eserine); EB1911 notes the poisonous dose may be rejected by the stomach, which fits the narrator’s worry that “old Calabar… should fail me.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Calabar_Bean

- **Item:** Identify the “place of Hotspur’s death” incarceration clue and intended prison/town (Page 37)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential strong place anchor (likely Shrewsbury area) for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Hotspur (Henry Percy) was defeated and killed at Shrewsbury in 1403; EB1911: “In 1403 Henry Percy… was defeated and killed at Shrewsbury by Henry IV.” This strongly suggests the “place of Hotspur’s death” pun points to Shrewsbury (and thus Shrewsbury prison/gaol as the incarceration locale). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Shrewsbury

- **Item:** What are the “Paulo Post Avorticists” (Page 37) and is “Paulo”/“Avorticists” a clue?
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify an art movement/exhibit used as a date or voice marker.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Reads as wordplay: Latin “paulo post” (“after a little while”) + “a Vorticists” → “post-Vorticists” (i.e., “a little after the Vorticists,” framed as a private view/exhibition). Source for “paulo post”: “Thus we say, I will see thee ‘paulo post,’ i.e. after a little while.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_I/Volume_VII/First_Epistle_of_John/Part_8

- **Item:** Interpret Page 37’s “open the bores” / “chamber within chamber” (weapon/evidence?) and the narrator’s “one… other” biographical remark
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify the murder method or narrator identity tell.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “open the bores” reads as firearm language: Chambers (1908) defines *bore* as “the size of the cavity of a gun” (supporting the gun-barrels/chambers reading alongside “chamber within chamber”). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Boomerang_Brine. “intrinsicated” appears to echo Shakespeare’s “knot intrinsicate” (*Antony and Cleopatra*, Act V), reinforcing the “concealed/entangled” sense. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Antony_and_Cleopatra_(1921)_Yale/Text/Act_V. No unique external source identified for the “one… other” biographical aside from this wording alone; treat as a narrator/voice tell and revisit if repeated.

  - **Type:** name/place/other

  - **Result:** Walt Whitman, “This Compost” (*Leaves of Grass*, “Autumn Rivulets”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass_(1882)/Autumn_Rivulets/This_Compost contains “What chemistry! That the winds are really not infectious…” and the bean/potato lines quoted on Page 40. The Flecker-related line (“And some to Flecker turn to pray…”) remains unresolved.

- **Item:** Identify the “bean bursts noiselessly…” / potato leaves line on Page 40

  - **Result:** Robert Browning, “Love Among the Ruins” (*Men and Women*, 1855): “Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force— / Gold, of course.” (Page:Men_and_Women,_Volume_1_-_Browning_(1855).djvu/16).

- **Item:** Identify what “panache… beneath my lips” refers to (Page 89)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a concrete prop (pipe/feather/food) or a self-description clue (moustache), helpful for voice clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Webster (1913) defines “panache” as “a plume or bunch of feathers” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Panache); in this context (“beneath my lips”) it’s LIKELY a plume-metaphor for facial hair (moustache/goatee).

- **Item:** Identify the narrator name clue: “Newbolt’s admiral” + “Shakespeare’s sergeant” + “capitalise my third letter” (Page 91)
  - **Type:** people/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely an identity cipher for the narrator; resolving it could collapse a whole voice cluster.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Newbolt’s “Admiral Death” (Page:Poems,_new_and_old_(IA_poemsnewold00newb).pdf/68) + Shakespeare’s “fell Sergeant death” (*Hamlet* V.2; Page:Shakespeare_-_First_Folio_Faithfully_Reproduced,_Methuen,_1910.djvu/797) → narrator name = DEATH; “capitalise my third letter” suggests styling it as De’Ath (DeAth).

  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Why it matters:** Appears as a sabotage/prevention statement (“knew too much to let it go up”); could be a place/vehicle/event anchor.

  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a specific detective-story reference and could explain the “green” clue embedded in the eyeball exhibit.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** The key phrase reads like the colloquial scepticism “Do you see any green in my eye?” (≈ “do you take me for a greenhorn/fool?”), attested in Sabine Baring-Gould, *The Frobishers* (1901), Chapter 20 (“…do you see any green in my eye?”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Frobishers/Chapter_20 and Theodore Goodridge Roberts, “The Red Pirogue” (*Popular* magazine, 1922), Chapter 4 (“Say, d’ye see any green in my eye?”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Red_Pirogue/Chapter_4. No direct pre-1934 match found yet for the “Cadaver Charlie” / “Chicago sleuth” framing.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved! …” (Page 92)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md

- **Item:** Identify what “Devona” refers to (Page 92)
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a brand/place/wordplay clue (childhood sweet “caddis-hoard of Devona”) and may recur across pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Devona appears as a branded sweetmeat made from Devonshire/clotted cream, sold in small packets: E. Skuse, *Skuse’s Complete Confectioner* (1894) advertises “DEVONA… The most Delicious Sweetmeat… Prepared from Fresh Devonshire Cream” (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jdFH7L3xLjwC&pg=PT9) and *Home Notes* (1895) advertises “DEVONA… The most exquisite Sweetmeat. Made from fresh Clotted Cream” (+ “CHOCOLATE DEVONA”) (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FVC2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA233). “caddis-hoard” still LIKELY echoes Kipling’s “Tomlinson” (1892): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ballads_and_Barrack-Room_Ballads/Tomlinson.

- **Item:** Identify the “M’Cullough… I’m dying to-night” stanza source (Page 93)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely a continuation fragment that could become an ordering anchor once the source is known; surrounding references (Tayside Inn; Wimpole Street) may narrow the source set.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Rudyard Kipling, “The Mary Gloster” (*The Seven Seas*, 1896): “And pipes for closets all over… But M’Cullough he died in the Sixties, and Well, I’m dying to-night …” (Page:The_Seven_Seas_(Kipling,_1896).djvu/168).

- **Item:** Identify “Wails of a Tayside Inn” and the “living poems” claim (Page 93)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a named author/source and anchor narrator reading set.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The “living poems… all the rest were dead” line is Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Children” (Birds of Passage): “For ye are living poems, / And all the rest are dead.” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Birds_of_Passage_(Collection)/Children). “Wails of a Tayside Inn” reads as a title-pun pointing to Longfellow via *Tales of a Wayside Inn*.

- **Item:** Identify the “Wimpole Street” quotation about “binding up their hearts… cerement of the grave” (Page 93)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md

  - **Result:** Yeats: “At Galway Races” (*Responsibilities*, 1916): “And we find hearteners among men / That ride upon horses.” (Page:Yeats_Responsibilities_1916.djvu/128). “Colonel Anthony” is LIKELY (Lt-)Col. Anthony St. Leger: Doncaster is famous for the annual St. Leger (“called after Colonel St. Leger… instituted them in 1776”; The_Nuttall_Encyclopædia/D) and *Alumni Oxonienses* notes “his brother, Anthony, founded the St. Leger Stakes in 1776” (Page:Alumni_Oxoniensis_(1715-1886)_volume_4.djvu/12).

- **Item:** Clarify “the darbs” meaning and usage (Page 94)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a precise slang/period marker or a coded clue-word.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Early 20th-c. slang “a darb” = something/someone excellent or notable (used as praise): “You’re a darb” (Hammett, *The Dain Curse*, Page:Dashiell_Hammett_-_The_Dain_Curse.pdf/241); plural used for “characters” (“I’ve got some darbs”) in Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (Page:The_sun_also_rises_-_Hemingway,_Ernest,_1899-1961.pdf/111).

- **Item:** Identify the narrator name printed in the window-sign (Page 94)
  - **Type:** people/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md

  - **Result:**

- **Item:** Identify “Holy Mr. Herbert” reference (Page 95)
  - **Type:** people/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Allusion anchor that may identify narrator reading set/voice.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Holy Mr. Herbert” is Izaak Walton’s epithet for George Herbert in *The Complete Angler* (5th ed.), Chapter V (“Come let me tell you what holy Mr. Herbert says of such days and flowers as these”), quoting Herbert’s “Vertue” (“Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright…”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Angler,_5th_edition/Chapter_V. (EB1911 and Marjorie Bowen’s 1910 story echo the epithet, but Walton is the most direct match to “these hours/days”.)

- **Item:** Identify “Mr. Haddock” and “Meed kissing laces” reference (Page 95)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely a layered allusion; resolving it may identify narrator voice and connect to other literary fragments.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Context suggests the surrounding “Holy Mr. Herbert… right about these hours” is via Walton’s *Complete Angler* (Chapter V, quoting Herbert’s “Vertue”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Angler,_5th_edition/Chapter_V. No direct pre-1934 match found yet for the exact “Meed kissing laces” phrase or a “Mr. Haddock” self-name in this context; keep open for a later pass (and treat “Mr. Haddock” as possibly fish/angler wordplay unless a textual source turns up).

- **Item:** Identify “Leda and Hebe” / “my swan a drink” (pen/ink clue) (Page 95)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could encode a pen brand/mythic mapping or an object clue used elsewhere (letters/confessions).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Mythic wordplay for “swan + drink”: EB1911 “Leda” says Zeus visited Leda “in the form of a swan” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Leda) and EB1911 “Hebe” notes she “acts as cupbearer to the gods” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Hebe) → “gave my swan a drink” reads as inking/filling a “Swan” fountain pen/ink. Supporting period usage: “Swan” appears as a fountain-pen ink name in *The Loudwater Mystery* (Chapter 16): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Loudwater_Mystery/Chapter_16.

- **Item:** Clarify the Café Royal / John Montagu gaming-table reference (Page 95)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor the setting and constrain time/route; may connect to other Café/club pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** John Montagu (Earl of Sandwich) allusion: the “arrangement” for staying at the gaming table refers to the sandwich origin story (invented so he could remain gambling without interruption). Source: *The Past at Our Doors Or The Old in the New Around Us* (1911), “The Story of Our Food”: “the now familiar ‘sandwich’… gets its name from the fourth Earl of Sandwich… invented it in order to remain at the gaming table without interruption” (https://ia601501.us.archive.org/33/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.84533/2015.84533.The-Past-At-Our-Doors-Or-The-Old-In-The-New-Around-Us_djvu.txt). Webster (1913) defines “Sandwich” as “[Named from the Earl of Sandwich]” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Sandwich).

- **Item:** Identify “Golden Tips / Tippy Tea / No Tips” (Page 96)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** The “tips” wordplay may identify the venue/menu register and clarify a tea-industry reference.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Golden tips” are tea “tips” (buds) — “the essence of the leaf” — sometimes separated and sold as pure “golden tips” (Henry W. Cave, *Golden Tips: A Description of Ceylon and its Great Tea Industry*, 1905: “Golden Tips… are the essence of the leaf… sometimes… sold as pure golden tips”: https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023639119/cu31924023639119_djvu.txt). “Tippy Tea” is LIKELY playful personification of tea with tips, and “No Tips” a pun on gratuities vs tea tips.

- **Item:** Identify whether “Loganberry Kiss” / “Plover’s Lunch” are specific menu/culture references (Page 96)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** May identify a specific venue/menu set and help cluster this narrator’s scene.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No exact pre-1934 match found yet for the named menu items; treat as likely in-world menu naming and keep open. Partial grounding: plover eggs are referenced as a food item in period literature (e.g., *The Green Carnation*, ch. 7: “No plover’s eggs, thank you”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Green_Carnation/Chapter_7, but “Plover’s Lunch” remains unconfirmed.

- **Item:** Confirm the source/usage of “It gars me grue” (Page 96)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** Dialect marker; clarifies that the narrator is using a Scots idiom meaning “it makes me shudder.”
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Scots phrasing built from “Gar… To cause; to make. [Obs. or Scot.]” (Webster 1913, https://www.websters1913.com/words/Gar) + “Grue… to shudder” (Chambers’s Twentieth Century Dictionary, 1908: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Grope_Gyve).

- **Item:** Identify “Jifjaffa” (place or pun) (Page 96)
  - **Type:** place/term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a strong place clue (Jaffa/Palestine?) or a pun; may recur across the narrator’s war/Padre reminiscence.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Jifjaffa” matches Jifjafa, a Turkish post in the central Sinai Range and a recurring place-name in Sinai/Palestine campaign accounts. G. H. Gullett, *The Australian Imperial Force in Sinai and Palestine, 1914–1918* (1923) describes it as “a post situated in the Sinai Range… some fifty-two miles east of the Canal” and narrates the April 1916 “Jifjafa raid”: https://archive.org/stream/australianimperi07gulluoft/australianimperi07gulluoft_djvu.txt (search “Jifjafa”).

  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** Clarifies that this is a “somersault” reference, not a county/place reference.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Webster 1913 defines “Somerset” (variant of “somersault”) as “a leap in which a person turns his heels over his head and lights upon his feet; a turning end over end” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Somerset).
