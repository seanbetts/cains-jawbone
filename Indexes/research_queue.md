## Open items

- **Item:** Identify the source of “graves of the martyrs… whaups… my heart remembers how”
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor narrator voice + setting; may encode date/place.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Louis Stevenson, “To S. R. Crockett” (*Songs of Travel and Other Verses*, 1896): “Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying, my heart remembers how.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Songs_of_Travel_and_Other_Verses/To_S._R._Crockett.

- **Item:** Identify/locate “St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine”
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
  - **Why it matters:** Setting anchor for clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY a constructed/in-world institution name built from Chambers (1908) definitions: “chine” = “a ravine” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Chapman_Chrysoprase) and “Lazar-house” = “a lazaretto” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Lawk_Liebig). No specific real-world “St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine” found; treat as a coastal-setting marker + institutional hint rather than a precise map-pin.

- **Item:** Identify plague-quote source on Page 2 + the “writer” who “died to-day” (and death date)
  - **Type:** quote/date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential explicit calendar anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Quotes are from Daniel Defoe’s *A Journal of the Plague Year* (1722); “the writer… died to-day” likely points to Defoe’s death date (24 April 1731), making “to-day” ≈ April 24.

- **Item:** Identify “O my mother was loath to have her go away…” / “red squaw never came…” quotation(s)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md
  - **Why it matters:** Quote anchor that may link multiple pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Walt Whitman, “The Sleepers” (*Leaves of Grass*, 1882): “O my mother was loth to have her go away… All the week she thought of her, she watched for her many a month… But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass_(1882)/The_Sleepers.

- **Item:** Which publishing firm is implied by “Austin Freeman, Oppenheim, and Mary Roberts Rinehart” (and how “Hodder” fits)?
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a character (publisher) or place clue.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Hodder & Stoughton (publisher). The narrator has “come upon the major half” (= Stoughton) and remarks that “Hodder” was not there. All three named authors have editions published by Hodder & Stoughton (e.g., Oppenheim, *The Falling Star* (1911): https://archive.org/stream/fallingstar00oppegoog/fallingstar00oppegoog_djvu.txt; Austin Freeman, *The Famous Cases of Dr. Thorndyke* (1929): https://archive.org/stream/famouscasesofdrt0000raus/famouscasesofdrt0000raus_djvu.txt; Mary Roberts Rinehart, *The Amazing Adventures of Letitia Carberry* (1919): https://archive.org/stream/amazingadventure00rine/amazingadventure00rine_djvu.txt).

- **Item:** What is the “assassin’s wonderful substance” (period usage; hashish/other?) and why is “17,600 yards” relevant?
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md
  - **Why it matters:** Connects pill/poison thread and a precise numeric clue.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Assassin” is “properly Hashīshīn, from Hashish” and the “fedais… were intoxicated with the hashīsh” (EB1911 “Assassin”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Assassin), so the “assassin’s wonderful substance” is LIKELY hashish/hasheesh. “17,600 yards” is exactly 10 miles (1760 yd/mile), suggesting an intentional “10 miles” distance marker.

- **Item:** Identify “Maestro Jimson” and the “piled abomination” whose title is referenced
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md
  - **Why it matters:** Cultural reference might place the scene/time and cluster narrators.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “The Maestro Jimson” is Chapter XI in Robert Louis Stevenson & Lloyd Osbourne’s *The Wrong Box* (1889): https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1585/pg1585.txt. In that chapter, “Jimson” is a composer persona involved with a decayed, “weedy” houseboat/hulk used as a hiding place while awaiting a corpse, which fits the narrator’s “piled abomination” framing.

- **Item:** Identify “Emperor’s Peg” (period recipe/associations)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Why it matters:** Drink/poison motif; could recur as continuity hook.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Peg” is a period term meaning “a drink of spirits” (Webster 1913: https://www.websters1913.com/words/Peg). “Applejack” is “cider brandy… derived by distillation from fermented cider” (New International Encyclopædia, 1905, “Cider”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Cider). “Vitriol” can mean sulphuric acid (“oil of vitriol”) or a metal sulphate (Webster 1913: https://www.websters1913.com/words/Vitriol). No independent pre-1934 recipe found for the named drink; treat “Emperor’s Peg” as an in-world “peg” being used as a poison delivery vehicle in Henry’s “equal parts” variant.

- **Item:** Interpret “cut out the stops” + “vaguely Buddhistic”
  - **Type:** term/quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely points to a specific text/phrase or decoding instruction.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The “stops” are the periods in “O.M.”; cutting them out yields “OM”, matching “vaguely Buddhistic” (cf. “Om mani padme hum” described as “a sacred formula in Buddhism” in *The New International Encyclopædia* (1905): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Om_Mani_Padme_Hum). The nearby “couple of letters” and Thomas Hardy/doctor-uncle reversal support O.M. ↔ M.O.

- **Item:** What are the “couple of letters” being “paraded… for all to see”?
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Why it matters:** Possible monogram/signage/initials clue for identifying a person/place.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “O.M.” (Order of Merit), explicitly framed via “Thomas Hardy had been” (Order of Merit described in *The New International Encyclopædia* (1905): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Merit,_Order_of). “my doctor uncle in the war had been just the reverse” reads as M.O. (Medical Officer), reinforcing the O.M./M.O. reversal and setting up OM once the “stops” are removed.

- **Item:** Identify the Troilus & Cressida “winter… lips of Cressida” quotation used on Page 6
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md
  - **Why it matters:** Precise-source anchor and possible encoding of a speaker/scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Shakespeare, *Troilus and Cressida* 4.5 — Achilles: “I’ll take what winter from your lips, fair lady: / Achilles bids you welcome.”

- **Item:** What is “Electric Febrifuge” and what “active ingredient” is implied?
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_6.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a drug/poison thread or period product clue.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Electric febrifuge” is a name for **gelseminum / gelsemium** (Carolina jessamine), a nerve-poison drug; its active alkaloids include **gelsemine** (and gelseminine). Murrell, *What to Do in Cases of Poisoning* (1884) lists “Electric febrifuge” under “Gelseminum” (p. 120): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NnQFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA120&dq=%22electric+febrifuge%22&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=8&source=gbs_api. EB1911 “Gelsemium” describes gelsemine/gelseminine and the drug’s nerve-toxin effects: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:EB1911_-_Volume_11.djvu/577.

- **Item:** What is meant by “a Jew’s lime” (and why it provides relief)?
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md
  - **Why it matters:** Odour/remedy motif; could be a specific product or slang.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Jew’s‑lime” (Hort.) is a grafting wax “composed of black pitch, turpentine, &c., burnt till the volatile parts are evaporated,” used “for engrafting” (strong smell fits “concomitant odour”). Crabb, *A Technical Dictionary…* (1851) p. 507: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JL9BAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA507&dq=%22Jew%27s+-+lime%22+engrafting&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Is “Charles Victor Hugo Renard-Beinsky” a traceable person/pseudonym or an allusive composite?
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_7.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might identify narrator/character via initials or literary references.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Renard‑Beinsky is a character (Charles Renard‑Beinsky) in Menyhért Lengyel’s play **Taifun** (1910) / **Typhoon** (1913), matching Page 7’s “rereading Typhoon” and “investigating judge” framing. Google Books snippet shows dialogue with “Monsieur Renard‑Beinsky” in Lengyel, *Typhoon* (1913): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fvY1AQAAIAAJ&q=%22Renard-Beinsky%22&dq=%22Renard-Beinsky%22&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api; and gives “Renard‑Beinsky: Charles” in Lengyel, *Taifun* (1910): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_TpIAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Renard-Beinsky%22&dq=%22Renard-Beinsky%22&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=10&source=gbs_api. Treat “Victor Hugo” in CJ as likely extra allusive middle names rather than a separate real person.

- **Item:** Confirm what “Guido… on the sausage place” refers to (likely Guido Reni + Bologna) and the intended date
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential explicit calendar anchor for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Guido” is likely Guido Reni (Italian painter) and “sausage place” is a Bologna pun; Guido Reni died in Bologna on 18 August 1642 → “to-day” ≈ Aug 18.

- **Item:** Confirm Kilmarnock + Balmerino reference and the intended date (“lost their heads”)
  - **Type:** date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential calendar anchor that may pair with “Guido” on the same “to-day”.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock, and Arthur Elphinstone, 6th Lord Balmerino, were executed by beheading on 18 August 1746 → corroborates “to-day” ≈ Aug 18.

- **Item:** Identify the “green-eyed streak” jealousy phrase on Page 8
  - **Type:** quote/term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md
  - **Why it matters:** Possible idiom/allusion anchor for narrator voice clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Alludes to Shakespeare’s jealousy line: “It is the green-ey’d monster…” (Iago, *Othello*, Act III, Scene III). Source: Shakespeare, *Othello* (Gutenberg #1531): https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1531/pg1531.txt

- **Item:** Identify the knob/mechanism and action sequence (Page 8 “black knobby thing”; Page 19 “polished knob”) and who Mr. Hall is
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Why it matters:** Mechanical/scene clue that likely connects pages and may identify setting/profession.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** A household/service call-bell (bell-push/knob): it’s “twiddled” to ring and summon a servant; Mr. Hall is the responding “lower orders” man/servant who enters when the bell is rung (cf. Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md opening: “The sound of the bell…”).

- **Item:** Define “josser/jossers” (Page 99) and confirm referent
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md
  - **Why it matters:** Supports the bow/“jossers” continuity that links Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md → Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md within `N02` (Dog POV).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Josser.—A simple fellow.” (C. J. Dennis, *The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke* (1915), Glossary): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Songs_of_a_Sentimental_Bloke/The_Glossary. In context, “the silly old jossers” reads as a jocular term for the missing scissors/implements needed to trim/adjust the bow ends, matching Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md’s “he found them and trimmed the left end.”

- **Item:** Identify which date “Hyacinth’s day” refers to (St. Hyacinth)
  - **Type:** date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md
  - **Why it matters:** Explicit calendar offsets (“went back two days”) could support ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Chambers’ *Book of Days* lists “St Hyacinth, confessor, 1257” under **August 16** → likely “Hyacinth’s day” = **Aug 16**. Corroboration: *Catholic Encyclopedia* (1913), “St. Hyacinth” gives “Feast, 16 Aug.”

- **Item:** Identify what “Jasmine’s day” refers to (and whether it’s a calendar anchor)
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md
  - **Why it matters:** The text contrasts it with “Hyacinth’s day” (“too late for Jasmine’s day”) and includes an explicit “went back two days” offset.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Not found as a named day/feast in Chambers’ *Book of Days*; may be an in-world/personal “day”, a name-day not covered by Chambers, or a different day-name system. Keep unresolved until a ≤1934 source is identified.

- **Item:** Identify “Gourdoulis” (Egyptian cigarettes)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md
  - **Why it matters:** Brand/product clue that recurs and may link scenes (class/period tell).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** A branded line of “Egyptian Cigarettes,” advertised as manufactured in **Alexandria, Egypt** (e.g., advert in *To-day* (1897) p. 86: “Gourdoulis’ Egyptian Cigarettes… (Factory: Alexandria, Egypt)”: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=unhNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA86&dq=Gourdoulis+Egyptian+cigarettes&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api). Also appears in UK retail price lists (e.g., Whiteley, *General Price List* (1913) p. 1201 lists “Gourdoulis & Co. (Alexandria)” Egyptian cigarettes): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IyJFAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1201&dq=Gourdoulis+Egyptian+cigarettes&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Identify “Etam dawn mist, ten inches” (product + measure)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md
  - **Why it matters:** Gift/retail clue; shade/size language may recur or locate a shopping context.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Etam is associated with stockings/hosiery (e.g., *The British Market for Hosiery* (1927) p. 8 discusses a French hosiery firm trading as “Etam”: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h8-YuNzprAIC&pg=PA8&dq=Etam+stockings&hl=&cd=11&source=gbs_api). “dawn mist” reads like a shade/colour name; “ten inches” likely a sizing/measurement spec, but the exact product description/sizing scheme has not yet been pinned to a ≤1934 catalogue.

- **Item:** Identify what “Orchard” and “Ravager” refer to in the Page 11 nautical passage
  - **Type:** place/name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor a specific quotation, ship, or location (supports clustering and ordering).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Direct quotation from Rudyard Kipling, “Thy Servant a Dog” (1930): “waited in Orchard, where he cast up blinded that night… my true friend Ravager… short legs…” (Google Books snippet): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hnwHAQAAIAAJ&pg=PT1&dq=%22waited+in+Orchard%22+Ravager&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api. “Orchard” is a place-name within the story; “Ravager” is the dog narrator’s friend (another dog), not a real-world ship/place anchor.

- **Item:** What is “the Grundy Sapphic of yesterday”?
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might identify a publication/poem used as a time/date anchor (“yesterday”).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY a wordplay pointer to the Sunday newspaper **Sunday Graphic** (often styled “Sunday Graphic and Sunday News”), i.e. “yesterday’s” Sunday paper. Willing’s *Press Guide* (1934) lists “SUNDAY GRAPHIC AND SUNDAY NEWS”: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4Ms5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA211&dq=%22Sunday+Graphic%22+%22Sunday+Pictorial%22&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Identify “The golden one is gone from the banquets… beloved of Atimetus” (and correct Atimetus/Admetus)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md
  - **Why it matters:** Quote anchor in will/inheritance thread; could encode identity/date.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Greek Anthology epigram “On Claudia Homonoea” (author unknown): Homonoea is described as “more golden than the Cyprian… at revellings and feasts” and she leaves tears to **Atimetus** (a distinct name, not Admetus). See J.W. Mackail, *Select Epigrams from the Greek Anthology* (1890), Epigram XLIII: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2378

- **Item:** Clarify the Noel Coward “King Charles’s Head” reference on Page 12
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_12.md
  - **Why it matters:** May be a precise allusion that clusters narrator voice or anchors a source text.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “King Charles’s head” is a Dickens allusion/idiom for a fixed idea/obsession (Mr. Dick in *David Copperfield* repeatedly returns to King Charles I’s head); Page 12 uses it as a pun on having “a very bad head” and taking aspirin. https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/766

- **Item:** Identify which market place has a conduit dated 1597
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strong location anchor for clustering and travel constraints.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Grantham, Lincolnshire — EB1911 “Grantham” states: “A conduit dating from 1597 stands in the wide market-place.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Grantham

- **Item:** What is meant by “Newdigate fringe” (Page 13)?
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be an identifying class/profession clue or period slang.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Newdigate” refers to the Oxford University “Newdigate” prize for English verse; “Newdigate fringe” reads as a Bloomsbury/poet stereotype label for the man’s hairstyle/appearance. EB1911 “Newdigate, Sir Roger”: “The ‘Newdigate’ prize … for English verse … at Oxford University.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Newdigate,_Sir_Roger

- **Item:** Identify Janetta Sheringham (real-person reference vs in-world character)
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md
  - **Why it matters:** Recurrence could link narrators/social circles; might be a disguised allusion.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No clear pre-1934 external match found yet for the exact name “Janetta Sheringham” (checked Wikisource search + Google Books keyword search). Treat as an in-world acquaintance until recurrence provides more anchors.

- **Item:** Identify John Hewit + Sarah Drew lightning incident (date/place) and the letter-writer (narrator’s namesake)
  - **Type:** date/place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely explicit calendar anchor (“on that very day”) and narrator identity clue (“namesake”).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** John Hewit and Sarah Drew were killed by lightning at harvest-work in a barley field on **the last day of July 1718** (July 31), commemorated at **Steeple Ashton**; Alexander Pope wrote an epitaph for them, and the event is described in a **letter by John Gay** (injury details match Page 15). Sources: Chambers, *The Book of Days* (July 31 “Lightning” entry) (Google Books full view: https://books.google.com/books?id=VEcJAAAAIAAJ); *The Gentleman’s Magazine* (1820) note on Steeple Ashton: https://books.google.com/books?id=mQaXYqwaZxgC

- **Item:** What does “Lyons” refer to on Page 15 (city vs Lyons tea-shop/Corner House)?
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_15.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor geography/time zone (or link to other “Lyons”/Lesurques references).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY Lyon, France (English “Lyons”), supported by the adjacent “coming of age hours” = 21:00 (24-hour clock pun: “coming of age” = 21) and EB1911 “Lyons (Fr. Lyon), a city of eastern France…” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Lyons

- **Item:** Identify the lyric “fondly sae did I o’ mine” (music-hall context)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor performer/repertoire and help date or cluster narrator.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Burns, “The Banks o’ Doon” — “And ilka bird sang o’ its luve, / And fondly sae did I o’ mine.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Burns%27_Popular_Songs/The_Banks_o%27_Doon

- **Item:** What/where are “the Moon” and “the Dawn” in Page 17 (venues/landmarks)?
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md
  - **Why it matters:** Physical setting anchor for the tea/meeting scene.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Text strongly suggests **named venues/buildings** (“visiting the Moon… to-day”; “Why go to pubs?”), but no specific real-world location has been identified yet. Note: “the Dawn” also appears on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md in a list of titled items (“Lover’s Delight”, “Banana Split”, “the Dawn”), so “Dawn” may be a venue name in some contexts and a menu/drink title in others; keep ambiguous until more anchors recur.

- **Item:** Identify “Moning” (tea name/brand?) referenced alongside Lapsang
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md
  - **Why it matters:** Product clue that may recur or locate the scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Moning” is an attested tea type in 19th-century tea-trade literature (often discussed as a blending tea for hard water and described as having a “tarry flavour”). See *Catalogue of Teas…* (1852) p. 79: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnUoM7KV1LsC&pg=PA79&dq=Moning+tea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api; also discussed as “Moning or Ningchow tea” in *A Short Account of Tea and the Tea Trade* (1878) p. 83: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V4ZPAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA83&dq=Moning+tea&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Identify the “namesake” quotation about dinner courses (soup → fish → birds) and the epigram line on Page 18
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_18.md
  - **Why it matters:** Namesake identification could pin the narrator; may connect to other epigram references.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “another of fishes… another of birds” is from **1 Corinthians 15:39** (KJV): “another of fishes, and another of birds” → Page 18 turns it into a menu-courses joke (adds “soup” ahead of the biblical “fishes… birds”), making the “namesake” LIKELY **St Paul**. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/1_Corinthians. The “epigram” cue is LIKELY the proverb “Many a true word is spoken in jest,” attested in Chaucer: “Ful ofte in game a sooth I have herd seye” (*Canterbury Tales*, ed. Skeat, “Monk”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Canterbury_Tales_(ed._Skeat)/Monk.

- **Item:** Confirm whether “Human Comedy… beyond to-day” is intended as a Balzac death-date anchor
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strengthens the mid-August calendar chain with Pages/cains_jawbone_page_8.md and Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Yes — “Human Comedy” points to Balzac’s *La Comédie humaine*; Balzac died in Paris on **18 August 1850**, so “to-day” is likely Aug 18 and corroborates the Aug 18 chain. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Balzac,_Honor%C3%A9_de

- **Item:** Identify the queen quotation (attributed to Wotton) and what “only just come to Falkland” refers to
  - **Type:** quote/place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_19.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could uniquely identify a queen/scene and link pages by historical context.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Quote is Sir Henry Wotton, “You meaner Beauties of the Night” (“On his Mistris, the Queen of Bohemia”): “By Vertue first, then Choyce a Queen… Th’ Eclypse and Glory of her kind.” (text reproduced in E. R. Eddison, *The Worm Ouroboros* (1922), ch. 30): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Worm_Ouroboros/Chapter_30. The “queen” is Elizabeth Stuart (Queen of Bohemia); “only just come to Falkland” likely alludes to her being born at Falkland Castle (Fifeshire/Fife) on 19 Aug 1596 (DNB): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Elizabeth_(1596-1662).

- **Item:** Confirm the “oldest brass in England” inscription (Sir John/Iohan Daubernoun) and its location (by the River Mole)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_20.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strong location anchor for ordering/travel constraints.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The inscription matches the marginal Norman‑French text on the brass of Sir John d’Aubernoun (c. 1277) at Stoke d’Abernon church, Surrey, described as the earliest extant English brass. Sources: Fox-Davies, *A Complete Guide to Heraldry* (1909), ch. 4: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Complete_Guide_to_Heraldry/Chapter_4 ; EB1911 “Brasses, Monumental”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Brasses,_Monumental ; EB1911 “Surrey”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Surrey (also notes the River Mole as a chief Surrey river, consistent with “by the Mole”).

- **Item:** Identify the epitaph line “Underneath this stone… as much Beauty as could die”

- **Item:** Interpret the poison/medical language around “proved digitalis purpurea… a signal wash out” and “Calabar Bean”
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a poisoning method and link to other plant/drug narrators.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** EB1911 confirms digitalis (foxglove leaves; *Digitalis purpurea*) as a cardiac drug and a “powerful diuretic” in small/moderate doses, which fits “signal wash out”; it is also described as a cumulative poison. Calabar bean is the seed of *Physostigma venenosum* (“ordeal bean” of Old Calabar), containing the alkaloid physostigmine (eserine), a potent and poisonous drug with marked antagonism to atropine. EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Digitalis ; https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Calabar_Bean

- **Item:** Identify “John and Cornelius, the Dort people” + the “good one in prison” whose birthday is referenced
  - **Type:** date/name
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_22.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential calendar anchor (“that day”) and a murder allusion that may recur.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** John and Cornelius “the Dort people” are Johan (John) de Witt (born at Dort on 24 Sept 1625) and his elder brother Cornelius de Witt; Cornelius is the one “in prison” (Gevangenpoort, Aug 1672) in the account of their lynching. A period biography gives Cornelius’s birthdate as 15 June 1623 (Parieu, *John de Witt; or, twenty years’ interregnum…* 1858, Google Books: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PnlZAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA7). EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/De_Witt,_John ; https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/De_Witt,_Cornelius

  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md
  - **Why it matters:** Spans pages and likely anchors an Irish-themed source.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** John Masefield, “Captain Stratton’s Fancy”: “But rum alone’s the tipple, and the heart’s delight / … Says the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Captain_Stratton%27s_Fancy. *Cain’s Jawbone* continues with “Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan” (cf. Yeats’s “Cathleen ni Houlihan”), apparently substituting the original line.

- **Item:** Clarify the match-related allusions on Page 23 (Bryant & May, Francis Thompson “sold matches”, “under the snow”, “eyes go out”)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a precise literary/historical allusion (matchgirls) used for dating/clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Page 23 blends match imagery with Oscar Wilde’s “Requiescat” (“Tread lightly, she is near / Under the snow” → “Rub gently, she is here, under the snow”) and Francis Thompson’s “Dream-Tryst” (“Nor can her eyes go out”), plus a biographical nod that Thompson “earn[ed] a few pence by selling matches” (Catholic Encyclopedia, 1913). Sources: Wilde “Requiescat”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Writings_of_Oscar_Wilde/Volume_1/Requiescat ; Thompson “Dream-Tryst”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Thompson)/Dream-Tryst ; Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) “Francis Thompson”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Francis_Thompson

- **Item:** Who are Fidelia Faustina Flora Blackwood and Ebenezer Blackwood, and what is the “Left Luggage Office” reference?
  - **Type:** name/place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md
  - **Why it matters:** Names may hide a clue (animal pedigree vs people); Left Luggage Office may be a scene anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** No clear pre-1934 external “Blackwood siblings” reference found; the given names do have explicit meanings in Chambers (1908) “Christian Names” (Fidelia = faithful; Faustina = fortunate; Flora = flowers; Ebenezer = “stone of help”), suggesting deliberate name-choice/wordplay. “Hocks” supports an animal reading (Chambers 1908: hough/hock = hind-leg joint of a quadruped). “Left Luggage Office” is railway-station luggage storage/office (e.g., *When William Came*, Chapter II: “booking office, left-luggage office…”). Sources: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/The_More_Common_English_Christian_Names ; https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Holywell_Hurry ; https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/When_William_Came/Chapter_II

  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a narrator/character and link to other Clement mentions (Page 3).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** EB1911 “Clement” opens “the name of fourteen popes and two anti-popes,” matching the Page 24 formulation and supporting “Clement” as a deliberate name clue. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Clement

- **Item:** Identify the Ahkoond of Swat reference and whether it links to other pages
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_24.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential shared-allusion anchor for narrator clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Ahkoond/Akhund of Swat” refers to the Akhund of Swat, Abdul Ghafur (1794–1877), a religious leader who held long “religious dominance” in Swat. EB1911 “Swat”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Swat

- **Item:** Identify the “gone the same way home” song and why “to-day” is asserted alongside Jeremy Taylor + Eugene Sue
  - **Type:** quote/date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_25.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a precise date anchor and a place-name hint (Didling).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Likely refers to the old song “All Go the Same Way Home” (song-title discussed in *The Literary Digest*, 1914: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GFENffy9hgwC&pg=PA890&vq=%22All+Go+the%22). “to-day” may be intended as a 3 Aug calendar hook via Eugène Sue’s death date (3 Aug 1857, EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Sue,_Eug%C3%A8ne) and Jeremy Taylor’s fever onset on 3 Aug 1667 (*The Living Age*, 1871: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FaRIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA8), though Taylor’s death date is 13 Aug 1667 (EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Taylor,_Jeremy). Didling is a real Sussex place (e.g., “Didling Hill, above Didling” in *Highways and Byways in Sussex*, Chapter 2: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Highways_and_Byways_in_Sussex/Chapter_2).

- **Item:** Identify “Ben Wade” (and why Hodge asks about him) on Page 26
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a character/allusion used as a recognition test or date anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Likely refers to a Ben Wade tobacco pipe (brand) rather than a person; e.g., *Life* (1912) runs an advert: “What could be sweeter than a Ben Wade pipe?” https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oE6vVC1I8TYC&pg=PA1&vq=%22Ben+Wade%22

- **Item:** What is meant by “like a bee with a sore bonnet” (“foreign touch”) on Page 26?
  - **Type:** term/quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a specific idiom/source that clusters narrator voice.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Likely a “foreign touch”/malapropism of the idiom “bear with a sore head” (e.g., Kipling, *The Light That Failed*, Ch. 12: “cheerful as a bear with a sore head”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Light_That_Failed/Chapter_12).

- **Item:** Identify the “county town on the Severn” lock-up allusion on Page 27 (and what “tapping” case/story it is)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_27.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor a specific location and link to a known case/story.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “County town on the Severn” most likely points to Shrewsbury (county town of Shropshire; situated on the river Severn) (EB1911 “Shrewsbury”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Shrewsbury). The “tapping… at the very walls… sign of a breach” reads as Death-as-burglar metaphor; no specific named “tapping case” source identified.

- **Item:** Identify the 1917 “tenth edition” book in Page 28 (device: “single star above what was perhaps a sea”)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md
  - **Why it matters:** Book/publisher device likely identifies narrator reading and may anchor place/time.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The passage quotes Oscar Wilde’s *The Importance of Being Earnest* (Act I, Lane: “I have only been married once… misunderstanding… No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject…”) https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest/Act_I. The “single star above… sea” device is likely the publisher’s imprint/series mark but is not yet independently corroborated.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “No, Sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it myself.” (Page 28)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md
  - **Why it matters:** Distinctive line might identify a speaker/source text and help cluster pages.

  - **Result:** Oscar Wilde, *The Importance of Being Earnest*, Act I (spoken by Lane): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest/Act_I

- **Item:** Clarify the poison/plant list on Page 29 (lobelia, “lords and ladies”) and what “the broad ones” are
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md
  - **Why it matters:** Supports the plant/poison method thread and may identify the narrator’s knowledge.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Lobelia” likely refers to *Lobelia inflata* (“Indian tobacco”); EB1911 describes lobelia as “a typical respiratory poison” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Lobelia). “Lords and ladies” is a common name for *Arum maculatum* (cuckoo-pint / wake robin); EB1911 notes aroids contain an “acrid poisonous juice” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Aroideae). “The broad ones” are most likely broad beans (*Vicia faba*), contrasted with West African ordeal beans/physostigma (EB1911 “Bean”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Bean).

- **Item:** Identify the “old mineralogist” on Page 29 (is this a known character elsewhere?)
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could connect to the Peebles/mineralogy narrator (Page 9) and support ordering/clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** No unique external identification found from the term alone; treat as an in-world, unnamed person (`P35`) and track for naming/recurrence. Possible continuity hook: “led… up the garden” phrasing also appears on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md; mineralogy is a strong profession-tell on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_9.md.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “this savours not of death, this hath a relish of eternity” (Page 30)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md
  - **Why it matters:** Quote used as a probe/test; may uniquely identify author and connect scenes.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** William Watson, “The Sovereign Poet” (in *The Collected Poems of William Watson*, 1899): the poem includes “This savours not of death, / This hath a relish of eternity.” (Google Books scan: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vidXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA166&dq=%22savours+not+of+death%22)

- **Item:** Identify the “jocund maker / De Mauves / Gressie” passage flagged “by James!” on Page 30
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_30.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor a specific author (“James”) and provide strong clustering evidence.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Louis Stevenson, *Underwoods* (1887), poem “Henry James”: “Lo, how these fair immaculate women walk / Behind their jocund maker… Slighted De Mauves… Gressie…” (Wikisource: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Underwoods/Henry_James). The “by James!” probe likely points to the poem’s title.

- **Item:** Confirm which “Gainsborough” is meant by “gone out to-day” and what date it implies
  - **Type:** date/name
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential explicit calendar anchor for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788); EB1911 notes his cancer “proved fatal on the 2nd of August” (1788) → “to-day” is likely **Aug 2**.

- **Item:** Identify the Wodehouse “drooping like a wet sock” Earl quote (and which Earl/scene)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could pin the narrator’s reading source and link pages using the same passage.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** P. G. Wodehouse, *Leave It to Psmith* (1923), “Dark Plottings at Blandings Castle” (opening) — Earl of Emsworth “drooping like a wet sock…”.

- **Item:** Identify Chesterton’s “hemp at both ends” line and what “it” refers to
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might clarify narrator’s “job” implication (hanging/rope/murder).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** G. K. Chesterton, *The Flying Inn* (1914), Chapter XXII — in a discussion of hashish: “I think it’s hemp at both ends” (hempen drink → murder → hempen rope).

- **Item:** Identify the quoted letter on Page 33 (“I had yours but yesterday… dated the third of February… departed spirits…”) and what “dead the same day” refers to
  - **Type:** quote/date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a strong source/date anchor and link to other letter/“alive but dead” motifs.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (published letters from the Constantinople period): “I had yours but yesterday, though dated the third of February, in which you suppose me to be dead and buried… I look upon my present circumstances to be exactly the same with those of departed spirits…” https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SYktgDb_eXQC&pg=PA100&dq=%22I+had+yours+but+yesterday%22. The Page 33 framing “a letter from a woman, dead the same day” most likely refers to the in-world woman whose effects include the letter, creating irony against the excerpt’s “still alive” claim (not a distinct external death-date anchor from this snippet alone).

- **Item:** What are the “little bits of stuff like black pineapple” on Page 33?
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_33.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might identify tobacco/food clue tied to Gourdoulis and the debt label.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY loose dark tobacco spilled from the opened/handled cigarette box (Gourdoulis); “pine-apple” can be used for “fir-cone” in older English, which fits the cone-like comparison (EB1911 “Heraldry”: “armorists have not surrendered this, our ancient word for the ‘fir-cone,’ to the foreign ananas”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Heraldry).

- **Item:** Interpret Page 31’s “Caseus, ah!” / “nomenclature business” (Cassius pun?) and the “rill and corncrake” sound duet
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might encode a specific source or identify a mechanical/vehicle scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Caseus, ah!” is a Cassius soundalike using Latin *caseus* (“cheese”), reinforced by the nearby Julius Caesar allusion “nothing lean or hungry here” (Cassius’s “lean and hungry look”). The “rill and corncrake” duet reads as metaphor for speeding: smooth running/“rill” vs a warning “crake/creak” (like an over-driven oak about to fall), i.e., competing vehicle/engine sounds rather than literal nature.

- **Item:** Identify the “awful night in Paris” reference on Page 31 (if it corresponds to a known event/source)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a repeatable historical anchor for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** No unique external event/source match identified from the wording alone; treat as narrator backstory and revisit only if Paris is tied to a more specific date/name elsewhere.

- **Item:** Identify Wellington Crisp and the “alas, poor Richard! Alas, poor Thomas!” allusion in the Henry manhunt scene
  - **Type:** name/quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might reveal a specific source text being pastiched (and anchor character identity).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** No external identification found for Wellington Crisp from the name alone; treat as an in-world detective/pastiche figure unless later anchored elsewhere. The “alas, poor Richard! Alas, poor Thomas!” line is a mixed quotation: Shakespeare, *Richard II* (York: “Alas, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?”) + Dryden, *The Mistaken Husband* (“Alas poor Thomas, we must all die!”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9kVwN_5fp_wC&pg=RA1-PA131&dq=%22alas,+poor+Richard%22 ; https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SxAcGP1I6TkC&pg=PA610&dq=%22alas,+poor+Thomas%22

- **Item:** Identify the “good uncle… father of your fortune… longed for this alliance” line in Page 36
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify an embedded source voice and link other pages quoting it.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The line is from Alfred, Lord Tennyson, “The Sisters” (“Your good uncle, whom you count the father of your fortune, longs for this alliance…”). *Cain’s Jawbone* shifts the tense (“longed”). https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O539WMK95hsC&pg=PA461&dq=%22father%20of%20your%20fortune%22

- **Item:** Confirm whether Page 36’s “old Calabar” failure refers to Calabar bean/physostigma poisoning logistics
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strengthens the plant/poison method thread and timing (“give him another day”).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Old Calabar” plausibly points to Calabar bean (*Physostigma venenosum*), a West African ordeal poison and source of physostigmine (eserine); EB1911 notes the poisonous dose may be rejected by the stomach, which fits the narrator’s worry that “old Calabar… should fail me.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Calabar_Bean

- **Item:** Identify the “place of Hotspur’s death” incarceration clue and intended prison/town (Page 37)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential strong place anchor (likely Shrewsbury area) for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Hotspur (Henry Percy) was defeated and killed at Shrewsbury in 1403; EB1911: “In 1403 Henry Percy… was defeated and killed at Shrewsbury by Henry IV.” This strongly suggests the “place of Hotspur’s death” pun points to Shrewsbury (and thus Shrewsbury prison/gaol as the incarceration locale). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Shrewsbury

- **Item:** What are the “Paulo Post Avorticists” (Page 37) and is “Paulo”/“Avorticists” a clue?
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify an art movement/exhibit used as a date or voice marker.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Reads as wordplay: Latin “paulo post” (“after a little while”) + “a Vorticists” → “post-Vorticists” (i.e., “a little after the Vorticists,” framed as a private view/exhibition). Source for “paulo post”: “Thus we say, I will see thee ‘paulo post,’ i.e. after a little while.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Nicene_and_Post-Nicene_Fathers:_Series_I/Volume_VII/First_Epistle_of_John/Part_8

- **Item:** Interpret Page 37’s “open the bores” / “chamber within chamber” (weapon/evidence?) and the narrator’s “one… other” biographical remark
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_37.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify the murder method or narrator identity tell.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “open the bores” reads as firearm language: Chambers (1908) defines *bore* as “the size of the cavity of a gun” (supporting the gun-barrels/chambers reading alongside “chamber within chamber”). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Boomerang_Brine. “intrinsicated” appears to echo Shakespeare’s “knot intrinsicate” (*Antony and Cleopatra*, Act V), reinforcing the “concealed/entangled” sense. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Antony_and_Cleopatra_(1921)_Yale/Text/Act_V. No unique external source identified for the “one… other” biographical aside from this wording alone; treat as a narrator/voice tell and revisit if repeated.

- **Item:** Identify Sonia Gordon and the Southend “tragic fortnight” story (Page 38)
  - **Type:** name/place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_38.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a specific anecdote/event used as an anchor; could recur with Sonia/cousin references.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No match found yet in Wikisource or Project Gutenberg for “Sonia Gordon”; Google Books searching is dominated by modern *Cain’s Jawbone* editions and has not yielded a clear pre-1934 external reference so far. Revisit if the name recurs or if a longer quoted span appears elsewhere.

- **Item:** Confirm whether the “Charlotte Brontë with the undulled blade” substitution (Page 38) is a deliberate recurring tell (Corday/Marat)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_38.md
  - **Why it matters:** If consistent, helps identify a narrator/voice pattern.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Corpus check: “Charlotte Brontë” / “Marat” do not recur elsewhere in page bodies (search across `Pages/`), suggesting this is a one-off intentional misnaming of the Corday/Marat assassination scene rather than a repeated narrator tell.

- **Item:** Confirm the intended “George Combe” / “Free Knowledgist” reference on Page 39 and what “two all for that year” refers to
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_39.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could link to phrenology/education motifs or a dated sporting reference.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** “George Combe” is LIKELY the Scottish phrenologist (DNB): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Combe,_George. “Free Knowledgist” is attested as “free-knowledgist” in Henry Clay Work, *Upshot Family: A Serio-comic Poem* (p. 16): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IK1cAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA16&dq=free-knowledgist (possible source for the epithet). “two all for that year” remains unresolved.

That the winds are really not infectious…” and the bean/potato lines quoted on Page 40. (2) James Elroy Flecker, “Yasmin” (a ghazel): https://books.google.com/books?id=-zVv2KCl7h0C&pg=PA333&dq=Some+to (source line: “some to Meccah turn to pray, and I towards thy bed, Yasmin”; Page 40 substitutes “Flecker” for “Meccah” and drops “Yasmin”.)

- **Item:** Identify the “bean bursts noiselessly…” / potato leaves line on Page 40
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md
  - **Why it matters:** Distinctive growth imagery may be a quotation and could help cluster the plant/poison narrator.

  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_40.md

  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Eric Parker, *Highways and Byways in Surrey* (1908), Ch. XXIII “The Dittons and Walton”: “Thames Ditton’s sister, Long Ditton…” https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057.txt.utf-8. The likely “Irishman’s malapropism” elsewhere in the same volume is the quoted phrase “Irishman’s lisping scream” (Derby-day excerpt in the Epsom chapter), which matches the “Irishman” + odd-wording pointer: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057.txt.utf-8.

- **Item:** Identify Henry’s “M’Cullough” quotation source (Page 41)
  - **Type:** quote

  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a cryptic place clue (London/Surrey) useful for ordering and clustering.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No definitive external anchor found yet. Working hypotheses: (1) a locality pun toward **(East) Molesey** (River Mole/Thames confluence area) + nearby Thames “islands/islets” (fits the Page 40 Ditton/Surrey cluster); (2) pure cryptic/anagram wordplay (“moled”→MODEL; “isled”→SLIDE/IDLES) paired with Selfridges/Bond Street shopping geography. Keep open for cross-page corroboration.

- **Item:** Identify the verse fragment about harp-strings and the desert (Page 42)
  - **Type:** quote

  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a specific venue/menu or a coded sequence (and help link Pages 42–43).
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** The “Alexander’s my name. They ca’d me Ecky when I was a boy…” passage is quoted from Robert Louis Stevenson & Lloyd Osbourne, *The Wrecker* (1892), Chapter 6: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Wrecker_(Stevenson)/Chapter_6. “Lover’s Delight” is attested as an ice-cream-parlour specialty (three small cones of ice cream on a sundae dish) in *The Spatula* (1922), p. 23: https://books.google.com/books?id=_hZOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA23&dq=%22Lover%27s+Delight%22. “the Dawn” also appears as a capitalised venue-name paired with “the Moon” on Pages/cains_jawbone_page_17.md (same voice has “bad for the hand” / avoiding “the stuff”), but no specific pre-1934 real-world “The Dawn”/“The Moon” venue match found yet in quick Wikisource/Gutenberg searches; revisit if more location anchors appear.

- **Item:** Identify the “honest station between King’s Cross and Edinburgh” clue (Page 43)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_43.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a solvable geographic anchor for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY **St Neots** (railway station/town): it sits on the King’s Cross northbound route (Great Northern/LNER corridor) and is explicitly listed among stations served by a “King’s Cross” train that is “continued to … Edinburgh” in *To-day* (1896): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gHdNAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22St.+Neots%22&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2 ; https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gHdNAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22King%27s+Cross%22&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2.

- **Item:** Confirm what “St. Bruno” refers to and whether it recurs (Page 44)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md
  - **Why it matters:** Brand/period/class tell that may help cluster scenes or narrators.

Villacabras is advertised as Spanish “Natural Mineral Purgative Water” in *Occidental Medical Times* (1892): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WagRAAAAYAAJ&dq=VILLACABRAS&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2. “Peter Barleys” is LIKELY a pun on “Peter Parley” (Samuel Griswold Goodrich): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Goodrich,_Samuel_Griswold. “Royans aux Achard(s)” matches a trademark/label recorded in *Bulletin officiel de la propriété industrielle et commerciale* (1886), p. 168: “ROYANS AUX TRUFFES & AUX ACHARDS” (Flouit Frères & C., Bordeaux): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YKNuP7yATQYC&pg=RA2-PA168-IA147&vq=ROYANS.

- **Item:** Interpret “half Pole, half Frenchman… usually up the first half” (Page 45)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a specific person, a nickname, or a repeated wordplay pattern.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The phrasing “half Pole, half Frenchman… drunken mongrel… lazy waster…” appears in Menyhért Lengyel, *Typhoon* (Methuen, 1913), p. 110 (tr. Laurence Irving): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fvY1AQAAIAAJ&dq=%22half%20Pole%22&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2. The CJ insertion “usually up the first half” remains unresolved.

- **Item:** Identify the “murderous doctor… friend… dear to me” quotation on Page 46
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify the “murderous doctor” and connect doctor-linked plot pages.

  - **Result:** Thomas De Quincey, “Second Paper on Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Second_Paper_on_Murder_considered_as_One_of_the_Fine_Arts (“The original ground of the transaction appears to have been sentimental: ‘He was my friend,’ says the murderous doctor; ‘he was dear to me’…”).

- **Item:** Clarify Page 46’s “Hal” naming + “matter of Jasmine” + multiple “Tom” references
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md
  - **Why it matters:** May identify the narrator (animal POV?) and connect to the broader jasmine/murder thread.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Reads as dog/pedigree wordplay: “Maltese” is a dog breed (listed under “Ladies’ toy dogs” in EB1911 “Dog”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Dog), and Chambers 1908 defines “Skye” as “for Skye terrier” (suggesting “our island” = Skye and the narrator is LIKELY a Skye terrier worrying about purity): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Simon-pure_Slope. “Some Tom” is LIKELY “Thomas” (De Quincey) as the preceding quoted sentence is from Thomas De Quincey’s “Second Paper…”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Second_Paper_on_Murder_considered_as_One_of_the_Fine_Arts, contrasted with a literal “tom” (tomcat) in the jasmine thread.

- **Item:** Interpret Page 46’s “visited England to-day for the first time” (calendar/date anchor)
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_46.md
  - **Why it matters:** If “to-day” is a daybook hook, it should anchor the page’s position relative to other calendar-key pages inside this narrator/cluster.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Chambers, *Book of Days* entry for **Dec 14** (“Albert, Prince Consort”) includes the line “Visited England in 1836…,” describing Albert’s first visit; CJ’s “to-day” phrasing therefore LIKELY points to **Dec 14** as the anchor. Source: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VEcJAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA697

- **Item:** Identify whether “Special Orange Supreme” is a specific tea/venue/menu item (Page 47)
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor a scene/venue or a coded menu sequence; links to tea motif pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Special Orange Supreme” is attested as a **menu item name** in *The Hotel Monthly* (menus section; “Special Orange Supreme” appears alongside “Orange Pekoe” tea listings): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uLvmAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA29&dq=Special+Orange+Supreme (also searchable via `jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2`). Treat as period menu language rather than a unique coded phrase.

- **Item:** Interpret Page 48’s Book of Common Prayer + “wormed his way” clue and the “Crataegus Oxyacantha” joke
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might encode a name (e.g., “May”) or date, and help cluster the dog/cocktail scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Crataegus Oxyacantha” = **hawthorn**, also called “white-thorn” or “may” (EB1911 “Hawthorn (plant)”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Hawthorn_(plant). The Book of Common Prayer contains the Psalter line “I am a worm, and no man” (Psalm 22:6 in the BCP Psalms): https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/29622/pg29622.txt. The Tate/BCP juxtaposition is LIKELY a second Tate reference: Nahum Tate coauthored the “New Version of the Psalms” (Tate & Brady), often bound with the BCP; Tate died **12 Aug 1715** (DNB): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Tate,_Nahum → candidate Aug 12 “to-day” anchor.

  - **Type:** quote/term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_50.md
  - **Why it matters:** Headline line may be a quotation or natural-history reference used as an ordering anchor.

  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_51.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a precise place/date/person anchor for “passing through” and may link a narrator/scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY a reference to the **Hambledon/Hampshire** cricket side: *Annals of Cricket* (1896) records a match “between the Duke of Dorset, with the **Hampshire men**, against **all England**” for **1000 guineas**: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QV0ElltRphYC&pg=PA36. A later summary in *Baily’s Magazine of Sports & Pastimes* (1925) notes the **Hambledon Cricket Club** “beat… All England… **twenty-nine times in ten years**” (citing Nyren’s “Young Cricketer’s Guide”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=twgbAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA226. “Yett(s)” = (Scot.) gate/door (Chambers 1908): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Y_Y-wis.

- **Item:** Confirm the date implied by Page 52’s Diamond Necklace cardinal acquittal reference
  - **Type:** date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_52.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely a “to-day” calendar key for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** EB1911 (“Diamond Necklace, The Affair of the”) states the sensational trial resulted (**May 31, 1786**) in acquittal of Cardinal de Rohan → “to-day” is **May 31**.

- **Item:** Determine whether Sir Paul Trinder is a real reference or an in-world satirical character (Page 53)
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_53.md
  - **Why it matters:** Helps interpret the interview scene and potential political/academic satire thread.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Sir Paul Trinder” appears to be a **literary character-name**, not a real public figure: Walter Besant, *Herr Paulus* (1888) includes “Sir Paul Trinder, Baronet.” https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sYYpAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA264&vq=%22Sir+Paul+Trinder%22. CJ’s added “furor loquendi” / newspaper-caricature framing may be a satirical overlay on the borrowed name.

- **Item:** Identify the source (if any) of “To pestle a poisoned poison behind his crimson lights” (Page 54)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_54.md

- **Item:** Identify the “English holiday… like that other fifth” reference in Page 55 (James; an Earl; brother Alexander)
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely a deliverance/plot holiday (potentially Gowrie day) giving a strong date anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Gowrie Conspiracy: James VI lured to Gowrie House, Perth; Alexander Ruthven + Earl of Gowrie killed on **5 Aug 1600** (Nuttall Encyclopaedia, “Gowrie Conspiracy”).

- **Item:** Identify which “Old Mill at Bramley” is meant on Page 55 (place ID)

  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a concrete geographic anchor and might connect to other Surrey/Kent pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Bramley in **Surrey** (near Guildford). Eric Parker, *Highways and Byways in Surrey* (1908), Ch. VIII “Shalford and Wonersh,” describes “Bramley… an old mill… with its medlar tree overhanging the water… its octagonal brick dovecot… and its sweet-water grape vine clambering on the old walls”—matching Page 55’s picture description: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057.txt.utf-8.

- **Item:** Interpret Page 55’s “hard/gentle” smell-chord sequence (encoding?)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_55.md
  - **Why it matters:** May be an intentional binary/musical/Morse-like code useful for ordering or identification.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No corroborating recurrence found in-page corpus. One possibility is Morse-like short/long signalling: treating “hard” as dash and “gentle” as dot gives `- . - - . . . -`, which can be split as `-.--` (Y) + `...-` (V); treat as a tentative hypothesis until a matching decode-key appears elsewhere.

- **Item:** Identify the “Asolo silk mills” / “Pippa” references in Page 56
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_56.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor narrator reading set (likely Browning/Asolo) and link other Browning-heavy pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Browning, *Pippa Passes* (1841): Pippa is a “girl from the Asolo silk mills” and sings “The year’s at the spring… Morning’s at seven…”.

- **Item:** Identify Brookesley and “Felton’s meat” (Page 57)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
  - **Why it matters:** May be a concrete place/product anchor for the paper-reading/ham scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`

LIKELY allusion: Felton’s “meat” = Buckingham/Villiers (the victim) rather than a literal meat supplier.

- **Item:** Identify the “no noise here… cowslips for her covering” quotation (Page 57)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a specific poem/source and connect other embedded verse fragments.

- **Item:** Clarify Armadale Castle as castle vs South Africa “boat” (Page 57)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_57.md
  - **Why it matters:** May disambiguate geography (Skye vs ship-route) and yield an ordering anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Two referents: Armadale Castle on Skye (seat of Lord Macdonald; EB1911 “Skye”) vs the mail steamer “Armadale Castle” in the Union-Castle mail fleet (EB1911 “Steamship Lines”)—hence “not the boat”.

- **Item:** Interpret Page 58’s “name month” and the “Nuts in May” / Freud punning
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might identify the narrator’s name/month or a calendar constraint.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Nuts in May” refers to the traditional children’s singing game (“Here we go gathering nuts in May…”), quoted and explicitly named “Nuts in May” in Kipling, “The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat” (*A Diversity of Creatures*, 1917): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Diversity_of_Creatures/The_Village_that_Voted_the_Earth_was_Flat (EB1911 also lists “Nuts in May” among children’s games: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Children%27s_Games). “Be not a Freud; thy help is near” puns on the chorus/anthem line “Be not afraid, thy help is near” (Words of Anthems Used in Westminster Abbey (1878), p. 109): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FD9GAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA109&vq=%22thy+help+is+near%22. Together, these reinforce May as the implied “name month” while keeping the “nuts/Freud” insanity joke active.

- **Item:** Identify Inspector Barraclough reference (Page 58)
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor the police/official-knock sequence and help link Henry pages.

  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_59.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could clarify the poison/method and link to other bird/phoenix/match imagery.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “kea” is a New Zealand mountain parrot (*Nestor notabilis*), noted for assaulting sheep (EB1911 “Nestor”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Nestor_(parrot). “Gelsemium semper-virens” is Carolina/wild yellow jessamine; EB1911 describes the drug as a nerve poison (alkaloids gelsemine/gelseminine) that can kill by arresting respiration: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Gelsemium.

  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Refers to **Ockham (Surrey)**: Peter King is “first Lord King, Baron of Ockham in Surrey” (DNB), and the DNB records he died “at his seat at Ockham” and has “a splendid monument by Rysbrach” in the parish church. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/King,_Peter_(1669-1734)

  - **Type:** other/place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor a specific year/incident and help cluster the narrator thread.

No specific printed “Guy Fawkes night” story located yet beyond the in-text mention; revisit if the anecdote is quoted more fully elsewhere.

- **Item:** Identify whether Darius Brockley / the vicar’s niece are in-world characters or a literary allusion
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_62.md
  - **Why it matters:** Determines whether these names should drive clustering/cast inference.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No pre-1934 match found for the exact names “Darius Brockley” or “the Vicar’s niece” as a quotation/allusion in quick Wikisource/Gutenberg searches; Google Books metadata queries return only modern *Cain’s Jawbone* editions. Treat as in-world names unless a fuller quotation recurs elsewhere.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “little springs of a fairy’s sofa” (Page 63)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a precise-source anchor for narrator voice or a decoding hint.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No match found yet in Wikisource search or Google Books for the exact phrase; may be an original simile rather than a quotation. Revisit if the “fairy sofa” image recurs elsewhere.

  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_64.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might encode a date (saint/anniversary “to-day”) and link the Great Lexicographer/fealty narrator cluster.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The “two things” are: (1) Byron, *Don Juan*, Canto XIII, stanza CVI (“The quaint, old, cruel coxcomb… / Should have a hook…”; angling + Izaak Walton): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Don_Juan_(Byron,_unsourced)/Canto_the_Thirteenth#CVI; and (2) Horace Smith, *The Tin Trumpet, Or Heads and Tales, for the Wise and Waggish* (Whittaker & Co., 1836), p. 35, defining the “Angler” as “a demure destroyer… old Izaak Walton” and including “postman, the bait… letters of Bellerophon” + “demure hypocrite, or a blockhead”: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i3HcLMJ36ucC&pg=PA35.

  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY Thomas Hardy’s short story “The Distracted Preacher” (reviewed as “The Distracted Young Preacher” in *Vanity Fair* (May 3, 1879) as appearing in *The New Quarterly*; the same review calls it “Hardy’s exquisite sketch… a delight from end to end”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=725HAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA246 and https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=725HAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA254.

- **Item:** Identify Monk Arnulphus / “Jim the Penman” references on Page 65
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_65.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might identify a profession/circle and tie into the paperwork/forgery thread.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Monk Arnulphus” is from a poem beginning “Monk Arnulphus uncorked his ink…” with the same “dragon-fly’s skin” / “gold-leaf… robe of a queen” lines: Alfred H. Miles (ed.), *The Poets and the Poetry of the Century: Charles Kingsley to James Thomson* (Hutchinson & Co., 1898), p. 391: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QaXbUNaq8G8C&pg=PA391&dq=Arnulphus. “Jim the Penman” is the play *Jim the Penman: A Romance of Modern Society in Four Acts* by Sir Charles Lawrence Young (S. French, 1880): https://books.google.com/books/about/Jim_the_Penman.html?id=kzUogQ-oDbUC.

- **Item:** Clarify what “pigeon-holing by type” implies on Page 65 (typewriter fonts? librarian systems? police records?)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_65.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a concrete profession tell and a scene-setting constraint.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Chambers 1908 defines “pigeon-hole” as “a division of a case for papers” and “to pigeon-hole” as “to put into a pigeon-hole” (i.e., file/put away): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Philopena_Pistachio. Chambers 1908 also defines “type” as including printing “a piece of metal… used in printing” (and “typist” as typewriter user): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Tup_Tzigany. So “pigeon-holing by type” plausibly points to literal clerical/printer work (filing/sorting papers or printing-type) and doubles as the narrator’s “personality type” joke.

- **Item:** Identify the school/institution implied by Pages 66–68 (fives courts + Hall + “Latham Chapel” fire in 1906)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_66.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could lock a real location and strongly cluster the narrator segment; the 1906 fire is a potential date/place anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Latham chapel” is a chapel within Selby Abbey (church of St Mary and St German), Selby, Yorkshire; EB1911 records a major fire on 19–20 Oct 1906 starting “in the Latham chapel adjoining the north choir aisle.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Selby.

  - **Why it matters:** Might identify the narrator’s birthplace and social circle; could anchor ordering via geography.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The clue points to **Haslemere (Surrey)**, and the CJ sentence closely paraphrases the Haslemere section of *Highways and Byways in Surrey* (1908): “Mrs. Allingham painted the Haslemere fish-shop… Sir Arthur Conan Doyle played cricket for Haslemere till he went up the hill… the Whympers we have met.” https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/28057.txt.utf-8 (Whymper corroboration: Josiah Wood Whymper had a country house at Haslemere and died there (DNB 1912 supplement): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1912_supplement/Whymper,_Josiah_Wood).

  - **Type:** date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md
  - **Why it matters:** If intentional, it’s a strong calendar key for ordering.

  - **Type:** quote/name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_67.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could clarify narrator cultural reference-set and strengthen clustering of this voice.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Partially resolved: “herb of grace” = rue (Ophelia: “There’s rue for you… We may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays…”) — Shakespeare, *Hamlet*, Act IV, Scene V (Gutenberg #1524): https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1524/pg1524.txt. “prejudicial Menkin” is LIKELY H. L. **Mencken** (surname misspelled) + his essay-collection series titled *Prejudices* (e.g., *Prejudices: First Series* (1919): https://archive.org/details/prejudicesfirst00mencgoog). Remaining items (“Helen and crooning”, “Poe and Prohibition”, “canvas-backed clams”) not yet pinned to a single specific referent; quick Wikisource/Archive searches did not yield a unique match.

- **Item:** Identify what “Alexander’s Ragtime Wedding Feast” refers to (Page 68)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a precise music-hall/song anchor or a deliberate “Alexander’s Ragtime Band” pointer.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** A riff on Irving Berlin’s 1911 song **“Alexander’s Ragtime Band”** (CJ swaps “Band” for “Wedding Feast” while keeping it as an “old tune” to whistle). Sheet music: Berlin, *Alexander’s Ragtime Band* (1911): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xABG0AEACAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Identify which Orpen painting (1912) is referenced by “the place between Eros and the Queen’s Hall” (Page 70)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could pin a London street/route (likely Regent Street) and constrain ordering by geography.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Orpen’s painting is “**The Café Royal**” (dated 1911–12), aligning with the “between Eros and the Queen’s Hall” London corridor clue: R. P., *Sir William Orpen* (1923), Plate 16 (“THE CAFÉ ROYAL. (1911-12)”): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hCChAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA16&dq=CAFE+ROYAL.

- **Item:** Interpret the “warnings of the Ming” / “modest Munich” / “Efate” bracket wordplay (Page 70)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_70.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might encode a name/route/instruction that affects ordering or motive.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Efate (Efaté) is an island-name in the New Hebrides, also called “Sandwich island” (EB1911 “New Hebrides”, footnote): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/New_Hebrides. The intended bracket/cipher operation around “Ming” / “Munich” remains unclear; MAYBE it cues a morphological build like `IM` + `MIGRATE` → “IMMIGRATE” (I(sland) + m(odest) + “Ming”→MIG + “expense”→RATE), but this is unverified.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “express my duty in his eye” (Page 71)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor narrator voice or link to other pages quoting the same source.

- **Item:** Identify “Herebald the Drake” (Page 71)
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be an allusion, genealogical joke, or hidden-name clue.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** “Herebald” is an attested early English name (a disciple of St John of Beverley; later abbot of Tynemouth) in the DNB: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/John_of_Beverley_(d.721). No pre-1934 source found for the combined phrase “Herebald the Drake”; LIKELY a deliberate comic malapropism/bluff (or conflation with a different “Drake” figure) until more context recurs.

- **Item:** Confirm what “Medehamstede” refers to in Page 72
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_72.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could lock a real location (likely Peterborough Abbey) and help cluster narrator travel.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Medehamstede” is the original name of **Peterborough** (England): EB1911 states Peterborough “is proved by its original name Medehamstede to have been a Saxon village…” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Peterborough_(England)

- **Item:** Identify Pasquier (claret) reference (Page 72)
  - **Type:** name/term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_72.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a brand/merchant clue that recurs in other food/drink pages.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No clear pre-1934 trace found for “Pasquier’s claret” as a named merchant/brand in quick Wikisource/Gutenberg searches; French Wikisource lookups for Rue de la Harpe context did not surface a Pasquier-linked wine shop. Treat “Pasquier” as an in-world acquaintance/wine-merchant placeholder until corroborated elsewhere.

  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_72.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a specific book used as an ordering/cipher key.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No pre-1934 “Savage Conqueror” title match located in quick Gutenberg/Wikisource catalogue searches; Google Books metadata queries for the exact title return only later works (and *Cain’s Jawbone* itself). Treat as an in-world “complete novel”/magazine title unless a clearer author/publisher clue appears.

- **Item:** Identify the painter identity clue + “The Mumpers” (Page 73)
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could reveal the narrator’s given name (and thus a stable narrator segment).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Points to painter **Augustus John** (surname “John”, which the narrator frames as a “given name”); EB1922 lists John’s works including “The Mumpers” (1912). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1922_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/John,_Augustus_Edwyn

- **Item:** Identify the “quiet country town” described on Page 73 (river + Tudor ruin + deer park + heather commons + immense woods)
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_73.md
  - **Why it matters:** Real geography could constrain ordering and cluster nearby scenes.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The description is a near-verbatim quotation of **Midhurst (Sussex)** from E. V. Lucas, *Highways and Byways in Sussex* (1904): “Midhurst… a quiet country town, gabled and venerable, unmodernised and unambitious, with a river, a Tudor ruin, a park of deer, heather commons, immense woods…” https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20696.txt.utf-8

- **Item:** Identify which Goya work is being referenced/confused (Page 74: “hanging man? a countess?”)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor a specific reproduction/title and link to other art references.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY contrast between (a) Goya portraits of the **Countess of Chinchón** (Doña Maria Teresa de Vallabriga, “Condesa de Chinchon”) and (b) a Goya print showing a **man hanging** (from *Los Desastres de la Guerra* / hangings captions). Both appear in Albert F. Calvert, *Goya, an account of his life and works* (Gutenberg #64514): https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/64514/pg64514.txt (see multiple “Condesa de Chinchon” entries and “man hanging”/“being hanged” captions in the print lists).

- **Item:** Clarify what “them” refers to in Page 74 (photos, documents, artworks, or something else)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_74.md
  - **Why it matters:** Determines whether this is an OGPU-documents/blackmail thread with cross-page continuity.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Them” most directly refers to the plural items “bought… secretly in Leningrad” (in the same exchange as the Goya reproduction); context suggests a bundle of purchasable physical objects (photographs/prints/reproductions and/or documents), rather than a person, with the Goya reproduction likely one of the set.

- **Item:** Confirm what “Indian tobacco” denotes and how it’s used on Page 75 (blight remedy vs poison)
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could tie into the plant/poison method thread and help interpret “blight on the May”.

Grieve also notes: “An infusion of Tobacco is generally used in horticulture as an insecticide” (Grieve, *A Modern Herbal*, “Tobacco”): https://www.botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/t/tobacc21.html, which fits the Page 75 “four-and-twenty hours… blight would be destroyed” surface reading (while still leaving room for poison-garden double-meaning).

- **Item:** Identify “Lord Pentarry” (Page 76)
  - **Type:** name/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be an in-world murderer exemplar or a literary allusion that anchors narrator reading set.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No clear pre-1934 match found for “Lord Pentarry” as a person/title (outside modern *Cain’s Jawbone* editions). MAYBE related to the place-name **Penterry** (Monmouthshire; “3 miles N. from Chepstow”): *The English Counties Delineated* (1837), p. 57: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=la0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA57&dq=Penterry&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “robbing a whirlwind to reap a scorpion” (Page 76)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely a deliberate proverb/quotation variant embedded in the narrator’s moral calculus; could cluster voices/pages.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No direct match found for the exact phrase in quick Wikisource/Gutenberg searches; reads like deliberate proverb-scrambling echoing Hosea 8:7 “sown the wind… reap the whirlwind” (KJV: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/Hosea) plus the “scorpions” chastisement motif (1 Kings 12:11: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bible_(King_James)/1_Kings). Treat as an intentional composite unless a specific ≤1934 source turns up.

- **Item:** Identify what “Compact” refers to (Page 77)

  - **Why it matters:** Clarifies whether aconite is being administered (means/method) versus merely shown.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Fleming’s tincture is a strong **tincture of aconite**; Taylor records a case where it was taken “under the supposition that it was flavored spirit,” matching Page 80’s point about mistaking it for a drink. Alfred Swaine Taylor, *A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence* (1897), p. 239: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cugRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA239&dq=Fleming%27s+tincture+of+aconite.

  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential strong anchor embedded in an in-world drowning murder; might encode a clue.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Browning, “In a Gondola” (in *Bells and Pomegranates*, First Series): “Death's to fear from flame or steel / Or poison doubtless, but from water—feel!” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bells_and_Pomegranates,_First_Series/In_a_Gondola

- **Item:** Decode “Quails and Arty and Fakes… Band, Speckled” (Page 81)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_81.md
  - **Why it matters:** Presented as misheard last words; may be an anagram/homophone pointer (possibly to Doyle’s “Speckled Band”).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The “Band, Speckled” fragment points directly to Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The Adventure of the Speckled Band”; the story’s memorable dying-words line is “It was the band! The speckled band!” (as printed in *The Strand Magazine*, Vol. 3, Issue 14): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Strand_Magazine/Volume_3/Issue_14/The_Adventure_of_the_Speckled_Band.

- **Item:** Identify “great asses of mice” and “to ladder danger” phrasing (Page 82)
  - **Type:** quote/term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a precise-source anchor or a clue phrase tied to the table/Lapsang/Henry segment.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Likely internal wordplay/anagram: “great asses of mice” → “great masses of ice” (letter-shift/splitting), and “(to) ladder danger” → “(to) garden ladder” / “garden ladder” (anagram).

- **Item:** Identify the “Poet Laureate” line about “brand o’ Cain” (Page 82)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could confirm narrator reading set and disambiguate which Henry segment this is.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** John Masefield (Poet Laureate from 1930) uses the phrase as part of a shipboard line: “one o’ the brand o’ Cain for mate ’n’ a human mistake for cook” (in *The Poems and Plays of John Masefield* (1918), p. 13): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hyiuUvTx8-AC&pg=PA13&dq=brand+o%27+Cain&source=gbs_api.

- **Item:** Identify the “slow sweet name” (Spanish) in Page 83
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a name/wordplay key for identifying a person or place in this flower/rose scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** This is Browning quoting himself: “I must learn Spanish, one of these days, / Only for that slow sweet name’s sake” appears in Robert Browning’s “The Flower’s Name” (Bells and Pomegranates, Second Series): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Bells_and_Pomegranates,_Second_Series/The_Flower%27s_Name. (The poem does not actually state the Spanish flower-name.)

- **Item:** Identify the metallic object dropped and retrieved in Page 83 (coin/key/other?)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a continuity prop linking scenes (and the “daughterly” companion).
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No external reference to pin this down; the text gives only “some metallic object,” so treat as a small dropped item (LIKELY coin/key) until a cross-page prop recurrence narrows it.

- **Item:** Identify the “blind sailor” reference/quote in Page 84
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a strong textual anchor for clustering and might encode a known story/line.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Refers to Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen (1801): when the signal to “discontinue the action” was hoisted, Nelson put his telescope to his blind eye and said he could not see it (a famous retold “blind eye” jest). Dictionary of National Biography (1885–1900), “Nelson, Horatio”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Nelson,_Horatio.

- **Item:** Identify whose arm went off “to-day” and whether it encodes a date (Page 84)
  - **Type:** date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential “to-day” calendar key similar to other historical markers.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Likely also Nelson: during the Santa Cruz (Tenerife) attack his right elbow was shattered by a bullet and “His arm had been amputated on board the Theseus,” on the night of 24 July 1797 (making “to-day” plausibly July 24). Dictionary of National Biography (1885–1900), “Nelson, Horatio”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Nelson,_Horatio.

- **Item:** Identify what “Kismet” is pointing to in Page 84 (play/film/allusion vs generic “fate”)
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_84.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a precise cultural anchor (play/film) or simply the fate/fortune term.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** In-period dictionary sense is straightforward: “Kismet… n. fate, destiny.” (Chambers’s Twentieth Century Dictionary, 1908): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/K_Kythe. Treat Page 84’s usage as the generic “fate” term unless further text indicates a specific play/film reference.

- **Item:** Identify “twin mouths of two lions” place reference (Page 85)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could pin a specific street/location (and possibly link to other “lions” references).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY Baker Street, London: “Mycroft’s brother” points to Sherlock Holmes (based at 221B Baker Street), and “Blake” reads as Sexton Blake (another fictional detective associated with Baker Street). Doyle, *A Study in Scarlet*, Part I, Ch. 2 (221B Baker Street): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet/Part_1/Chapter_2. Sexton Blake + “Baker Street” co-occur in *The Union Jack* (1906) snippets: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=35wNBYtmVRcC&jscmd=SearchWithinVolume2&q=Baker+Street.

- **Item:** Identify “pale but multitudinous Blake” and the Kipling name-jibe clue (Page 85)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could reveal narrator name/identity or a key allusive mapping (Blake vs Kipling).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Blake” is LIKELY Sexton Blake (fictional detective; positioned here alongside Holmes as another “lion” investigator; long-running, “multitudinous” publication history). *The Union Jack* (1894) frames him explicitly as “Sexton Blake, … detective”: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SwGvLuNbn90C&pg=RA1-PA1&dq=%22Sexton+Blake%22+detective&source=gbs_api. The “whiskified objectionable one” reads as wordplay: **KIPLING = K(LIP)ING** (“lip” = where whiskers sit; inserted into “king” = objectionable one), implying the narrator’s name was “guyed” from **King → Kipling**.

- **Item:** Identify what “the murderer that is to be hung next day” refers to (Page 85)
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be an explicit calendar anchor or an in-world legal event.
  - **Status:** `resolved`

- **Item:** Identify the poem/source for “quiet feet… old bold mate of Henry Morgan” (Pages 86–87)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md
  - **Why it matters:** The quotation is split across pages, giving a strong ordering anchor; the source may also identify a narrator’s reading set.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Yeats, “The Song of Red Hanrahan” in *In the Seven Woods* (1903): “But we have all bent low and low and kissed the quiet feet / Of Cathleen the daughter of Houlihan” (Page:In_the_Seven_Woods,_Yeats,_1903.djvu/32); CJ substitutes “Of the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.”

- **Item:** Identify “What is removed drops horribly in a pail” and the implied “tool” (Page 86)
  - **Type:** quote/term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md
  - **Why it matters:** Presented as something a “tool” said; may identify a weapon/implement or a precise-source anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Walt Whitman, *Leaves of Grass* (“Song of Myself”): “The malformed limbs are tied to the surgeon’s table, / What is removed drops horribly in a pail” (Page:Leaves_of_Grass_(1882).djvu/45) → “tool” likely echoes surgeon/anatomist instruments (knife/saw).

- **Item:** Determine the calendar date for St. Wigbert’s day (Page 88)
  - **Type:** date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md
  - **Why it matters:** Potential date anchor for ordering (similar to other saint-day “to-day” cues).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** *Catholic Encyclopedia* (“St. Wigbert”) records him in the *Martyrologium Romanum* under **13 August** → St. Wigbert’s day = **Aug 13**.

- **Item:** Identify “good Tate” and the “new distemper” context (Page 88)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_48.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a strong allusive anchor or clarify whether the scene is domestic (paint) vs something else.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Tate” reads as a sugar brand: EB1911 “TATE, SIR HENRY” says he made “Tate’s Cube Sugar” famous (Page:EB1911_-_Volume_26.djvu/478). “Distemper” is paint: EB1911 “PAINTER-WORK” notes “for distemper water is employed” (Page:EB1911_-_Volume_20.djvu/496).

- **Item:** Confirm the Whistler/Wilde “You will, Oscar, you will” quotation (Page 90)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md
  - **Why it matters:** Distinct cultural allusion that may help cluster a narrator segment; confirm exact wording/source.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Frank Harris, *Oscar Wilde, His Life and Confessions* (1916), Chapter 4: Wilde says “I wish I had said that.” Whistler replies: “You will, Oscar, you will.”

- **Item:** Identify the “thousand chariots… gold of course” allusion (Page 90)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might encode a specific reference (religious/classical/occult) tied to the “hermit” old gentleman.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Browning, “Love Among the Ruins” (*Men and Women*, 1855): “Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force— / Gold, of course.” (Page:Men_and_Women,_Volume_1_-_Browning_(1855).djvu/16).

- **Item:** Identify what “panache… beneath my lips” refers to (Page 89)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a concrete prop (pipe/feather/food) or a self-description clue (moustache), helpful for voice clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Webster (1913) defines “panache” as “a plume or bunch of feathers” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Panache); in this context (“beneath my lips”) it’s LIKELY a plume-metaphor for facial hair (moustache/goatee).

- **Item:** Identify the narrator name clue: “Newbolt’s admiral” + “Shakespeare’s sergeant” + “capitalise my third letter” (Page 91)
  - **Type:** people/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely an identity cipher for the narrator; resolving it could collapse a whole voice cluster.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Newbolt’s “Admiral Death” (Page:Poems,_new_and_old_(IA_poemsnewold00newb).pdf/68) + Shakespeare’s “fell Sergeant death” (*Hamlet* V.2; Page:Shakespeare_-_First_Folio_Faithfully_Reproduced,_Methuen,_1910.djvu/797) → narrator name = DEATH; “capitalise my third letter” suggests styling it as De’Ath (DeAth).

- **Item:** Identify “The Blue Rocket” reference (Page 91)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Why it matters:** Appears as a sabotage/prevention statement (“knew too much to let it go up”); could be a place/vehicle/event anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Blue rocket” is a common name for aconite / wolfsbane / monkshood (*Aconitum napellus*): EB1911 “Poison” (Aconite Poisoning), Page:EB1911_-_Volume_21.djvu/928.

- **Item:** Identify the Cadaver Charlie / Chicago sleuth / “see any green” anecdote (Page 91)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a specific detective-story reference and could explain the “green” clue embedded in the eyeball exhibit.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** The key phrase reads like the colloquial scepticism “Do you see any green in my eye?” (≈ “do you take me for a greenhorn/fool?”), attested in Sabine Baring-Gould, *The Frobishers* (1901), Chapter 20 (“…do you see any green in my eye?”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Frobishers/Chapter_20 and Theodore Goodridge Roberts, “The Red Pirogue” (*Popular* magazine, 1922), Chapter 4 (“Say, d’ye see any green in my eye?”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Red_Pirogue/Chapter_4. No direct pre-1934 match found yet for the “Cadaver Charlie” / “Chicago sleuth” framing.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved! …” (Page 92)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strong stanza-level anchor that may identify narrator reading set and aid clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Browning, “Saul” (*Men and Women*, 1855), stanza 2: “Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved! …” (Page:Men_and_Women,_Volume_2_-_Browning_(1855).djvu/120).

- **Item:** Identify what “Devona” refers to (Page 92)
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a brand/place/wordplay clue (childhood sweet “caddis-hoard of Devona”) and may recur across pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Devona appears as a branded sweetmeat made from Devonshire/clotted cream, sold in small packets: E. Skuse, *Skuse’s Complete Confectioner* (1894) advertises “DEVONA… The most Delicious Sweetmeat… Prepared from Fresh Devonshire Cream” (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jdFH7L3xLjwC&pg=PT9) and *Home Notes* (1895) advertises “DEVONA… The most exquisite Sweetmeat. Made from fresh Clotted Cream” (+ “CHOCOLATE DEVONA”) (https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FVC2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA233). “caddis-hoard” still LIKELY echoes Kipling’s “Tomlinson” (1892): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ballads_and_Barrack-Room_Ballads/Tomlinson.

- **Item:** Identify the “M’Cullough… I’m dying to-night” stanza source (Page 93)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely a continuation fragment that could become an ordering anchor once the source is known; surrounding references (Tayside Inn; Wimpole Street) may narrow the source set.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Rudyard Kipling, “The Mary Gloster” (*The Seven Seas*, 1896): “And pipes for closets all over… But M’Cullough he died in the Sixties, and Well, I’m dying to-night …” (Page:The_Seven_Seas_(Kipling,_1896).djvu/168).

- **Item:** Identify “Wails of a Tayside Inn” and the “living poems” claim (Page 93)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a named author/source and anchor narrator reading set.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The “living poems… all the rest were dead” line is Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, “Children” (Birds of Passage): “For ye are living poems, / And all the rest are dead.” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Birds_of_Passage_(Collection)/Children). “Wails of a Tayside Inn” reads as a title-pun pointing to Longfellow via *Tales of a Wayside Inn*.

- **Item:** Identify the “Wimpole Street” quotation about “binding up their hearts… cerement of the grave” (Page 93)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could confirm an Elizabeth Barrett Browning (Wimpole Street) source/allusion and provide a precise quotation anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Elizabeth Barrett Browning, “The Cry of the Children”: “They are binding up their hearts away from breaking, / With a cerement from the grave.” (Page:Poems_Barrett.djvu/241).

- **Item:** Identify the Yeats quotation and the “Colonel Anthony” commemoration (Page 94)
  - **Type:** quote/date/place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might anchor a location or annual date; could also identify narrator reading set.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Yeats: “At Galway Races” (*Responsibilities*, 1916): “And we find hearteners among men / That ride upon horses.” (Page:Yeats_Responsibilities_1916.djvu/128). “Colonel Anthony” is LIKELY (Lt-)Col. Anthony St. Leger: Doncaster is famous for the annual St. Leger (“called after Colonel St. Leger… instituted them in 1776”; The_Nuttall_Encyclopædia/D) and *Alumni Oxonienses* notes “his brother, Anthony, founded the St. Leger Stakes in 1776” (Page:Alumni_Oxoniensis_(1715-1886)_volume_4.djvu/12).

- **Item:** Clarify “the darbs” meaning and usage (Page 94)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a precise slang/period marker or a coded clue-word.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Early 20th-c. slang “a darb” = something/someone excellent or notable (used as praise): “You’re a darb” (Hammett, *The Dain Curse*, Page:Dashiell_Hammett_-_The_Dain_Curse.pdf/241); plural used for “characters” (“I’ve got some darbs”) in Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (Page:The_sun_also_rises_-_Hemingway,_Ernest,_1899-1961.pdf/111).

- **Item:** Identify the narrator name printed in the window-sign (Page 94)
  - **Type:** people/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
  - **Why it matters:** The narrator seeing their own name “printed… in great letters” is a strong identity anchor if the exact wording can be matched elsewhere.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** LIKELY the narrator’s surname is **King**: Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md suggests a schoolboy nickname “Kipling” formed by “whiskifying” an “objectionable one” → K(LIP)ING = King + “lip” (where whiskers sit); Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md then notes seeing “my own name… printed… in great letters.” Treat the window-sign as reading “KING” unless a longer exact form turns up elsewhere.

- **Item:** Identify “Holy Mr. Herbert” reference (Page 95)
  - **Type:** people/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Allusion anchor that may identify narrator reading set/voice.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Holy Mr. Herbert” is Izaak Walton’s epithet for George Herbert in *The Complete Angler* (5th ed.), Chapter V (“Come let me tell you what holy Mr. Herbert says of such days and flowers as these”), quoting Herbert’s “Vertue” (“Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright…”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Angler,_5th_edition/Chapter_V. (EB1911 and Marjorie Bowen’s 1910 story echo the epithet, but Walton is the most direct match to “these hours/days”.)

- **Item:** Identify “Mr. Haddock” and “Meed kissing laces” reference (Page 95)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely a layered allusion; resolving it may identify narrator voice and connect to other literary fragments.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** Context suggests the surrounding “Holy Mr. Herbert… right about these hours” is via Walton’s *Complete Angler* (Chapter V, quoting Herbert’s “Vertue”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Angler,_5th_edition/Chapter_V. No direct pre-1934 match found yet for the exact “Meed kissing laces” phrase or a “Mr. Haddock” self-name in this context; keep open for a later pass (and treat “Mr. Haddock” as possibly fish/angler wordplay unless a textual source turns up).

- **Item:** Identify “Leda and Hebe” / “my swan a drink” (pen/ink clue) (Page 95)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could encode a pen brand/mythic mapping or an object clue used elsewhere (letters/confessions).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Mythic wordplay for “swan + drink”: EB1911 “Leda” says Zeus visited Leda “in the form of a swan” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Leda) and EB1911 “Hebe” notes she “acts as cupbearer to the gods” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Hebe) → “gave my swan a drink” reads as inking/filling a “Swan” fountain pen/ink. Supporting period usage: “Swan” appears as a fountain-pen ink name in *The Loudwater Mystery* (Chapter 16): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Loudwater_Mystery/Chapter_16.

- **Item:** Clarify the Café Royal / John Montagu gaming-table reference (Page 95)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor the setting and constrain time/route; may connect to other Café/club pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** John Montagu (Earl of Sandwich) allusion: the “arrangement” for staying at the gaming table refers to the sandwich origin story (invented so he could remain gambling without interruption). Source: *The Past at Our Doors Or The Old in the New Around Us* (1911), “The Story of Our Food”: “the now familiar ‘sandwich’… gets its name from the fourth Earl of Sandwich… invented it in order to remain at the gaming table without interruption” (https://ia601501.us.archive.org/33/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.84533/2015.84533.The-Past-At-Our-Doors-Or-The-Old-In-The-New-Around-Us_djvu.txt). Webster (1913) defines “Sandwich” as “[Named from the Earl of Sandwich]” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Sandwich).

- **Item:** Identify “Golden Tips / Tippy Tea / No Tips” (Page 96)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** The “tips” wordplay may identify the venue/menu register and clarify a tea-industry reference.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Golden tips” are tea “tips” (buds) — “the essence of the leaf” — sometimes separated and sold as pure “golden tips” (Henry W. Cave, *Golden Tips: A Description of Ceylon and its Great Tea Industry*, 1905: “Golden Tips… are the essence of the leaf… sometimes… sold as pure golden tips”: https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023639119/cu31924023639119_djvu.txt). “Tippy Tea” is LIKELY playful personification of tea with tips, and “No Tips” a pun on gratuities vs tea tips.

- **Item:** Identify whether “Loganberry Kiss” / “Plover’s Lunch” are specific menu/culture references (Page 96)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** May identify a specific venue/menu set and help cluster this narrator’s scene.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No exact pre-1934 match found yet for the named menu items; treat as likely in-world menu naming and keep open. Partial grounding: plover eggs are referenced as a food item in period literature (e.g., *The Green Carnation*, ch. 7: “No plover’s eggs, thank you”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Green_Carnation/Chapter_7, but “Plover’s Lunch” remains unconfirmed.

- **Item:** Confirm the source/usage of “It gars me grue” (Page 96)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** Dialect marker; clarifies that the narrator is using a Scots idiom meaning “it makes me shudder.”
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Scots phrasing built from “Gar… To cause; to make. [Obs. or Scot.]” (Webster 1913, https://www.websters1913.com/words/Gar) + “Grue… to shudder” (Chambers’s Twentieth Century Dictionary, 1908: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Grope_Gyve).

- **Item:** Identify “Jifjaffa” (place or pun) (Page 96)
  - **Type:** place/term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a strong place clue (Jaffa/Palestine?) or a pun; may recur across the narrator’s war/Padre reminiscence.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Jifjaffa” matches Jifjafa, a Turkish post in the central Sinai Range and a recurring place-name in Sinai/Palestine campaign accounts. G. H. Gullett, *The Australian Imperial Force in Sinai and Palestine, 1914–1918* (1923) describes it as “a post situated in the Sinai Range… some fifty-two miles east of the Canal” and narrates the April 1916 “Jifjafa raid”: https://archive.org/stream/australianimperi07gulluoft/australianimperi07gulluoft_djvu.txt (search “Jifjafa”).

- **Item:** Clarify “turning a Somerset” meaning (Page 96)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** Clarifies that this is a “somersault” reference, not a county/place reference.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Webster 1913 defines “Somerset” (variant of “somersault”) as “a leap in which a person turns his heels over his head and lights upon his feet; a turning end over end” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Somerset).

- **Item:** Identify the French mandoline lyric (“Oeuvre ton ame… ma mandoline…”) (Page 97)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md
  - **Why it matters:** Strong language-anchored quotation that may identify narrator reading set or supply ordering constraints.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Paul Verlaine, “Sérénade” (*Poèmes saturniens*, 1866): “Ouvre ton âme… De ma mandoline… Cruelle et câline.” (Page:Verlaine_-_Poèmes_saturniens,_Lemerre,_1866.djvu/112).

- **Item:** Identify “Ellen Brine of Allenburn would never mwore return” (Page 97)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md
  - **Why it matters:** Dialect quotation (possibly Dorset-related) may anchor a specific source and narrator segment.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** William Barnes, “Ellen Brine ov Allenburn” (*Poems of Rural Life in the Dorset Dialect*, 1879): “… Ellen Brine ov Allenburn / Would never mwore return.” (Page:Barnes_(1879)_Poems_of_rural_life_in_the_Dorset_dialect_(combined).djvu/219).

- **Item:** Interpret “despatch of Paris and Leonidas” + Cambridge/Thermopylae contrast (Page 97)
  - **Type:** date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could encode a historical date or set of anniversaries used for ordering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Paris” is a pun on Dr **John Ayrton Paris** (a physician, i.e., a “healer”), who “graduated M.B. at Cambridge in 1808” (DNB: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Paris,_John_Ayrton). “Leonidas” is the Spartan king associated with Thermopylae (EB1911: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Leonidas). The contrast reads as Cambridge (Dr Paris) vs Thermopylae (Leonidas), rather than a single explicit calendar date.

- **Item:** Identify “sedulous ape” / “Simple faith or Norman bluff” / “Douglas” references (Page 98)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_98.md
  - **Why it matters:** May clarify whether the page is about a doctor/patient, a hire, or an allusive passage; could also cluster narrator voice.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Played the sedulous ape” is Robert Louis Stevenson on learning style by imitation (“The Question of Style”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Craftsmanship_of_Writing/The_Question_of_Style. “Douglas… tender and more true” alludes to Walter Scott, *Marmion*, Canto Fifth, line 460–461 (“More tender and more true: Forgive me, Douglas, once again”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Marmion/Canto_Fifth. “Simple faith or Norman bluff?” reads as internal rhetoric/wordplay; no external fixed phrase found.

- **Item:** Identify the “Quarry hills” setting (Page 98)
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_98.md
  - **Why it matters:** Landscape anchor (sunset “above the Quarry hills”) may pin a location cluster if matched elsewhere.
  - **Status:** `stalled`
  - **Result:** No clear unique place-match found (the phrase is too generic in print); treat “Quarry hills” as descriptive landscape wording unless another page supplies a stronger geographic anchor.

- **Item:** Identify the eye-description passage, “Father Fred”, and “closing day in Potsdam” (Page 99)
  - **Type:** quote/date/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_99.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a precise-source quotation and/or date anchor; also appears in a page with an explicit killing admission.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** The “most excellent, potent, brilliant eyes…” passage is quoted (via James Thomson citing Carlyle) as describing **Friedrich/Frederick the Great**: “Their intellects are as the eyes of Friedrich pictured by Carlyle… Most excellent, potent, brilliant eyes…” (James Thomson, “The Ring and the Book” essay): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Biographical_and_critical_studies_by_James_Thomson_(%22B.V.%22)/%22The_Ring_and_the_Book%22. “Father Fred” is thus LIKELY Friedrich/Frederick (nickname “Fred”). “Closing day in Potsdam” points to Frederick II’s death at Sanssouci (Potsdam) on 17 Aug 1786 (EB1911 “Frederick II. of Prussia”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Frederick_II._of_Prussia).

- **Item:** Identify the Kursal + Woolworth’s routing clue (Page 100)
  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a specific town/venue pairing and provide hard geographic ordering constraints.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Kursal” is LIKELY the **Kursaal** at Southend(-on-Sea), Essex (period sources refer to “Kursaal, Southend”): *The Freemason and Masonic Illustrated* (1909) mentions “Kursaal, Southend” (p. 14): https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zpowAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA14&dq=Kursaal%2C+Southend&source=gbs_api. (See also EB1911 “Southend-on-Sea” for the town: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Southend-on-Sea.)

- **Item:** Identify the two quoted lines in Page 100 (“bur o’ the world…”; “ill’s all here… about my heart”) (Page 100)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely strong voice-identification anchors embedded in a climactic collapse scene.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Here I shake off the bur o’ the world, man’s congregation shun” is Francis Thompson, “An Anthem of Earth” (in *New Poems*, 1897), p. 93: https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SZo-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&dq=bur+o%27+the+world&source=gbs_api. “How ill all’s here about my heart” is Shakespeare, *Hamlet* Act V (1917 Yale text): “I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart; but it is no matter.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Hamlet_(1917)_Yale/Text/Act_V.
