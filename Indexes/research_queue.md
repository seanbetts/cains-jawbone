- **Item:** Identify the source of “graves of the martyrs… whaups… my heart remembers how”
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor narrator voice + setting; may encode date/place.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Louis Stevenson, “To S. R. Crockett” (*Songs of Travel and Other Verses*, 1896): “Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying, my heart remembers how.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Songs_of_Travel_and_Other_Verses/To_S._R._Crockett.

  - **Type:** place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_1.md
  - **Why it matters:** Setting anchor for clustering.
  - **Status:** `in-progress`
  - **Result:** Not yet pinned to a specific real place; “chine” is a coastal ravine/gorge to the sea (term used on the Hampshire/Dorset and Isle of Wight coasts, e.g. “Boscombe Chine”), so this reads like a (possibly fictional) venue/church/institution situated in such a ravine. “St. Lazarus” in a place-name may also hint at a lazar-house/lazaretto (hospital for plague/leprosy/contagious disease per EB1911 “Lazar”), which fits the “is full… already” wording and the valetudinarian father nearby.

- **Item:** Identify plague-quote source on Page 2 + the “writer” who “died to-day” (and death date)
  - **Type:** quote/date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md

  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Quotes are from Daniel Defoe’s *A Journal of the Plague Year* (1722); “the writer… died to-day” likely points to Defoe’s death date (24 April 1731), making “to-day” ≈ April 24.

  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md

  - **Type:** quote/term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md
  - **Why it matters:** Presented as something a “tool” said; may identify a weapon/implement or a precise-source anchor.

  - **Result:** Walt Whitman, *Leaves of Grass* (“Song of Myself”): “The malformed limbs are tied to the surgeon’s table, / What is removed drops horribly in a pail” (Page:Leaves_of_Grass_(1882).djvu/45) → “tool” likely echoes surgeon/anatomist instruments (knife/saw).

- **Item:** Determine the calendar date for St. Wigbert’s day (Page 88)
  - **Type:** date
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_88.md

  - **Why it matters:** Could be a strong allusive anchor or clarify whether the scene is domestic (paint) vs something else.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Tate” reads as a sugar brand: EB1911 “TATE, SIR HENRY” says he made “Tate’s Cube Sugar” famous (Page:EB1911_-_Volume_26.djvu/478). “Distemper” is paint: EB1911 “PAINTER-WORK” notes “for distemper water is employed” (Page:EB1911_-_Volume_20.djvu/496).

- **Item:** Confirm the Whistler/Wilde “You will, Oscar, you will” quotation (Page 90)

- **Item:** Identify the “thousand chariots… gold of course” allusion (Page 90)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_90.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might encode a specific reference (religious/classical/occult) tied to the “hermit” old gentleman.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Robert Browning, “Love Among the Ruins” (*Men and Women*, 1855): “Yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force— / Gold, of course.” (Page:Men_and_Women,_Volume_1_-_Browning_(1855).djvu/16).

- **Item:** Identify what “panache… beneath my lips” refers to (Page 89)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_89.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a concrete prop (pipe/feather/food) or a self-description clue (moustache), helpful for voice clustering.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Webster (1913) defines “panache” as “a plume or bunch of feathers” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Panache); in this context (“beneath my lips”) it’s LIKELY a plume-metaphor for facial hair (moustache/goatee).

- **Item:** Identify the narrator name clue: “Newbolt’s admiral” + “Shakespeare’s sergeant” + “capitalise my third letter” (Page 91)
  - **Type:** people/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely an identity cipher for the narrator; resolving it could collapse a whole voice cluster.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Newbolt’s “Admiral Death” (Page:Poems,_new_and_old_(IA_poemsnewold00newb).pdf/68) + Shakespeare’s “fell Sergeant death” (*Hamlet* V.2; Page:Shakespeare_-_First_Folio_Faithfully_Reproduced,_Methuen,_1910.djvu/797) → narrator name = DEATH; “capitalise my third letter” suggests styling it as De’Ath (DeAth).

- **Item:** Identify “The Blue Rocket” reference (Page 91)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Why it matters:** Appears as a sabotage/prevention statement (“knew too much to let it go up”); could be a place/vehicle/event anchor.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Blue rocket” is a common name for aconite / wolfsbane / monkshood (*Aconitum napellus*): EB1911 “Poison” (Aconite Poisoning), Page:EB1911_-_Volume_21.djvu/928.

- **Item:** Identify the Cadaver Charlie / Chicago sleuth / “see any green” anecdote (Page 91)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might be a specific detective-story reference and could explain the “green” clue embedded in the eyeball exhibit.
  - **Status:** `in-progress`
  - **Result:** The key phrase reads like the colloquial scepticism “Do you see any green in my eye?” (≈ “do you take me for a greenhorn/fool?”), attested in Sabine Baring-Gould, *The Frobishers* (1901), Chapter 20 (“…do you see any green in my eye?”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Frobishers/Chapter_20 and Theodore Goodridge Roberts, “The Red Pirogue” (*Popular* magazine, 1922), Chapter 4 (“Say, d’ye see any green in my eye?”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Red_Pirogue/Chapter_4. Still no direct match found yet for the “Cadaver Charlie” / “Chicago sleuth” framing.

- **Item:** Identify the source of “Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved! …” (Page 92)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md

- **Item:** Identify what “Devona” refers to (Page 92)
  - **Type:** term/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a brand/place/wordplay clue (childhood sweet “caddis-hoard of Devona”) and may recur across pages.
  - **Status:** `in-progress`
  - **Result:** The surrounding phrasing “caddis-hoard” echoes Kipling’s “Tomlinson” (1892): “As children rifle a caddis-case or the raven’s foolish hoard.” https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ballads_and_Barrack-Room_Ballads/Tomlinson. Still no confirmed pre-1934 source found for “Devona” itself as a sweet/brand/place in this context.

- **Item:** Identify the “M’Cullough… I’m dying to-night” stanza source (Page 93)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely a continuation fragment that could become an ordering anchor once the source is known; surrounding references (Tayside Inn; Wimpole Street) may narrow the source set.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Rudyard Kipling, “The Mary Gloster” (*The Seven Seas*, 1896): “And pipes for closets all over… But M’Cullough he died in the Sixties, and Well, I’m dying to-night …” (Page:The_Seven_Seas_(Kipling,_1896).djvu/168).

- **Item:** Identify “Wails of a Tayside Inn” and the “living poems” claim (Page 93)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could identify a named author/source and anchor narrator reading set.
  - **Status:** `resolved`

- **Item:** Identify the “Wimpole Street” quotation about “binding up their hearts… cerement of the grave” (Page 93)
  - **Type:** quote
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_93.md

  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Elizabeth Barrett Browning, “The Cry of the Children”: “They are binding up their hearts away from breaking, / With a cerement from the grave.” (Page:Poems_Barrett.djvu/241).

- **Item:** Identify the Yeats quotation and the “Colonel Anthony” commemoration (Page 94)
  - **Type:** quote/date/place
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
  - **Why it matters:** Might anchor a location or annual date; could also identify narrator reading set.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Yeats: “At Galway Races” (*Responsibilities*, 1916): “And we find hearteners among men / That ride upon horses.” (Page:Yeats_Responsibilities_1916.djvu/128). “Colonel Anthony” is LIKELY (Lt-)Col. Anthony St. Leger: Doncaster is famous for the annual St. Leger (“called after Colonel St. Leger… instituted them in 1776”; The_Nuttall_Encyclopædia/D) and *Alumni Oxonienses* notes “his brother, Anthony, founded the St. Leger Stakes in 1776” (Page:Alumni_Oxoniensis_(1715-1886)_volume_4.djvu/12).

- **Item:** Clarify “the darbs” meaning and usage (Page 94)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a precise slang/period marker or a coded clue-word.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Early 20th-c. slang “a darb” = something/someone excellent or notable (used as praise): “You’re a darb” (Hammett, *The Dain Curse*, Page:Dashiell_Hammett_-_The_Dain_Curse.pdf/241); plural used for “characters” (“I’ve got some darbs”) in Hemingway, *The Sun Also Rises* (Page:The_sun_also_rises_-_Hemingway,_Ernest,_1899-1961.pdf/111).

- **Item:** Identify the narrator name printed in the window-sign (Page 94)
  - **Type:** people/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md

- **Item:** Identify “Holy Mr. Herbert” reference (Page 95)
  - **Type:** people/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Allusion anchor that may identify narrator reading set/voice.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Holy Mr. Herbert” is Izaak Walton’s epithet for George Herbert in *The Complete Angler* (5th ed.), Chapter V (“Come let me tell you what holy Mr. Herbert says of such days and flowers as these”), quoting Herbert’s “Vertue” (“Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright…”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Angler,_5th_edition/Chapter_V. (EB1911 and Marjorie Bowen’s 1910 story echo the epithet, but Walton is the most direct match to “these hours/days”.)

- **Item:** Identify “Mr. Haddock” and “Meed kissing laces” reference (Page 95)
  - **Type:** quote/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Likely a layered allusion; resolving it may identify narrator voice and connect to other literary fragments.
  - **Status:** `in-progress`
  - **Result:** Context now suggests the surrounding “Holy Mr. Herbert… right about these hours” is via Walton’s *Complete Angler* (Chapter V, quoting Herbert’s “Vertue”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Angler,_5th_edition/Chapter_V. Next: locate the exact source of the “Meed kissing laces” phrase and why “Mr. Haddock” is given as the self-name (possibly a fishy pun, but unconfirmed).

- **Item:** Identify “Leda and Hebe” / “my swan a drink” (pen/ink clue) (Page 95)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could encode a pen brand/mythic mapping or an object clue used elsewhere (letters/confessions).
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Mythic wordplay for “swan + drink”: EB1911 “Leda” says Zeus visited Leda “in the form of a swan” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Leda) and EB1911 “Hebe” notes she “acts as cupbearer to the gods” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Hebe) → “gave my swan a drink” reads as inking/filling a “Swan” fountain pen/ink. Supporting period usage: “Swan” appears as a fountain-pen ink name in *The Loudwater Mystery* (Chapter 16): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Loudwater_Mystery/Chapter_16.

- **Item:** Clarify the Café Royal / John Montagu gaming-table reference (Page 95)
  - **Type:** place/other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_95.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could anchor the setting and constrain time/route; may connect to other Café/club pages.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** John Montagu (Earl of Sandwich) allusion: the “arrangement” for staying at the gaming table refers to the sandwich origin story (invented so he could remain gambling without interruption). Source: *The Past at Our Doors Or The Old in the New Around Us* (1911), “The Story of Our Food”: “the now familiar ‘sandwich’… gets its name from the fourth Earl of Sandwich… invented it in order to remain at the gaming table without interruption” (https://ia601501.us.archive.org/33/items/in.ernet.dli.2015.84533/2015.84533.The-Past-At-Our-Doors-Or-The-Old-In-The-New-Around-Us_djvu.txt). Webster (1913) defines “Sandwich” as “[Named from the Earl of Sandwich]” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Sandwich).

- **Item:** Identify “Golden Tips / Tippy Tea / No Tips” (Page 96)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** The “tips” wordplay may identify the venue/menu register and clarify a tea-industry reference.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Golden tips” are tea “tips” (buds) — “the essence of the leaf” — sometimes separated and sold as pure “golden tips” (Henry W. Cave, *Golden Tips: A Description of Ceylon and its Great Tea Industry*, 1905: “Golden Tips… are the essence of the leaf… sometimes… sold as pure golden tips”: https://archive.org/stream/cu31924023639119/cu31924023639119_djvu.txt). “Tippy Tea” is LIKELY playful personification of tea with tips, and “No Tips” a pun on gratuities vs tea tips.

- **Item:** Identify whether “Loganberry Kiss” / “Plover’s Lunch” are specific menu/culture references (Page 96)
  - **Type:** other
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** May identify a specific venue/menu set and help cluster this narrator’s scene.
  - **Status:** `in-progress`
  - **Result:** No exact period match yet for the named menu items. Partial grounding: “Loganberry” = Logan Berry (hybrid fruit named after Judge J. H. Logan; “from him it derives its name”), per “Logan Berry: One of the Greatest Novelties of the Season” (1895): https://archive.org/stream/loganberryoneof1895paja_0/loganberryoneof1895paja_0_djvu.txt (so “Loganberry Kiss” may be a berry-flavoured menu name). Plover eggs appear as a food item in period literature (e.g., *The Green Carnation*, ch. 7: “No plover’s eggs, thank you”): https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Green_Carnation/Chapter_7; “Plover’s Lunch” may allude to such a dish but remains unconfirmed.

- **Item:** Confirm the source/usage of “It gars me grue” (Page 96)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** Dialect marker; clarifies that the narrator is using a Scots idiom meaning “it makes me shudder.”
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Scots phrasing built from “Gar… To cause; to make. [Obs. or Scot.]” (Webster 1913, https://www.websters1913.com/words/Gar) + “Grue… to shudder” (Chambers’s Twentieth Century Dictionary, 1908: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Grope_Gyve).

- **Item:** Identify “Jifjaffa” (place or pun) (Page 96)
  - **Type:** place/term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** Could be a strong place clue (Jaffa/Palestine?) or a pun; may recur across the narrator’s war/Padre reminiscence.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** “Jifjaffa” matches Jifjafa, a Turkish post in the central Sinai Range and a recurring place-name in Sinai/Palestine campaign accounts. G. H. Gullett, *The Australian Imperial Force in Sinai and Palestine, 1914–1918* (1923) describes it as “a post situated in the Sinai Range… some fifty-two miles east of the Canal” and narrates the April 1916 “Jifjafa raid”: https://archive.org/stream/australianimperi07gulluoft/australianimperi07gulluoft_djvu.txt (search “Jifjafa”).

- **Item:** Clarify “turning a Somerset” meaning (Page 96)
  - **Type:** term
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_96.md
  - **Why it matters:** Clarifies that this is a “somersault” reference, not a county/place reference.
  - **Status:** `resolved`
  - **Result:** Webster 1913 defines “Somerset” (variant of “somersault”) as “a leap in which a person turns his heels over his head and lights upon his feet; a turning end over end” (https://www.websters1913.com/words/Somerset).

- **Item:** Identify the French mandoline lyric (“Oeuvre ton ame… ma mandoline…”) (Page 97)
