  - **Instances / variants:** “second pill”; promised “full ration” + “act of justice”
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_3.md
  - **Notes:** LIKELY hashish/hasheesh (EB1911 “Assassin” derives assassin from Hashīshīn “from Hashish” and notes fedais “were intoxicated with the hashīsh”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Assassin). Track Clement + pill dosing language for recurrence.

  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md
  - **Notes:** “Peg” is a term for “a drink of spirits” (Webster 1913: https://www.websters1913.com/words/Peg). “Applejack” is cider brandy (New International Encyclopædia, 1905, “Cider”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_New_International_Encyclop%C3%A6dia/Cider). “Vitriol” can mean sulphuric acid (“oil of vitriol”) or a metal sulphate (Webster 1913: https://www.websters1913.com/words/Vitriol). No independent recipe found for “Emperor’s Peg”; treat the name as in-world, with Henry’s “equal parts” variant functioning as a poison-delivery motif.

  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md

  - **Instances / variants:** “started… on the foxgloves”; “proved digitalis purpurea”

  - **Notes:** Digitalis (foxglove) is described as a cardiac drug and a “powerful diuretic” in small/moderate doses (EB1911 “Digitalis”), which may explain the Page 21 “signal wash out” phrasing; also described as a cumulative poison. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Digitalis

- **Gelsemium (“Electric febrifuge”)**

Page 33’s “little bits of stuff like black pineapple” is LIKELY loose dark tobacco spilled from the box; “pine-apple” can be used for “fir-cone” in older English (EB1911 “Heraldry”: https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Heraldry).

- **Stockings / hosiery (Etam)**

Crabb, *A Technical Dictionary…* (1851) p. 507: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JL9BAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA507&dq=%22Jew%27s+-+lime%22+engrafting&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api.

See *Catalogue of Teas…* (1852) p. 79: http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gnUoM7KV1LsC&pg=PA79&dq=Moning+tea&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api; and *A Short Account of Tea and the Tea Trade* (1878) p. 83 (“Moning or Ningchow tea”): http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V4ZPAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA83&dq=Moning+tea&hl=&cd=4&source=gbs_api.

- **Book device (star above sea)**
  - **Instances / variants:** blind-tooled green binding with “single star above what was perhaps a sea”; “tenth edition (1917)”
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_28.md

  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_29.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md
  - **Notes:** Lobelia (“Indian tobacco”) is *Lobelia inflata*; EB1911 describes lobelia as “a typical respiratory poison” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Lobelia). “Lords and ladies” is *Arum maculatum* (cuckoo-pint / wake robin); EB1911 notes aroids contain an “acrid poisonous juice” (https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Aroideae). Reinforces poison-garden experimentation motif; Page 75 frames “Indian tobacco” as a blight-killing remedy (watch for double-use as poison).

  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_75.md
