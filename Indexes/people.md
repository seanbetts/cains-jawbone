  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_2.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_4.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_5.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_11.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_13.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_14.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_16.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_21.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_26.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_31.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_32.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_35.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_36.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_41.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_42.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_44.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_45.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_47.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_49.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_58.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_60.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_63.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_68.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_71.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_76.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_77.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_78.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_80.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_82.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_83.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_85.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_86.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_87.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_91.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_92.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_94.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_97.md, Pages/cains_jawbone_page_100.md
  - **Notes:** MAYBE multiple different “Henrys” across the book; do not merge/split without stronger anchors (surname, role, setting continuity). Resolved check (2025-12-25, `N12` falsifier): “Henry” appears in incompatible roles across `N12` sub-strands (killer/suspect under pursuit vs “peerless investigator”) → treat name-only matches as non-binding.

  - **Pronouns/relationships:** “he”; connected to Boots’ misunderstanding.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_10.md

Treat “Victor Hugo” in CJ as likely extra allusive middle names rather than a separate real-world person. See `Indexes/research_queue.md`.

  - **Notes:** Pages 46/88/99 are not explicit, but “matter of Jasmine” + “remember her” reads most parsimoniously as the same household cat; falsifier: later text makes Jasmine clearly human or otherwise non-cat in this strand.

- `P25` — Names/aliases: Tusitala (uncertain)
  - **Tells:** “Tusitala… come over to our place” (visitor; could be allusion or pet name).

  - **Pronouns/relationships:** sister of Ebenezer Blackwood.
  - **Pages:** Pages/cains_jawbone_page_23.md
  - **Notes:** Could be a person vs named animal; “hocks” suggests animal anatomy (Chambers 1908: hough/hock = hind-leg joint of a quadruped). https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/Holywell_Hurry. Chambers (1908) also lists the given names as meaningful Christian names: Fidelia = faithful; Faustina = fortunate; Flora = flowers. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Chambers%27s_Twentieth_Century_Dictionary_1908/The_More_Common_English_Christian_Names
